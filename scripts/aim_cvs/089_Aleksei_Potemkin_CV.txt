Domain Expertise, Management, Startup Experience

I try to focus most of my time on work as that's were i can see the most impact i can make. beyond work, i ocasionally climb mountains (Mt Kilimontjaro and Mt Kinabalu) or kitesurf (IKO certified).

i have been directly involved (together with a CEO) in the Series A and series B fundraising of osome.com (VC funding). I was preparing the materials, helping with the finencial model, reaching out to investors, setting up the meetings, pitching in 1/3 of the meetings etc

i'd donate 3%-5% divided between



80% - to¬†All Grants Fund @ Givewell - will try to persue the biggest return on the dollar invested, but i also believe that we need to be ok with the higher uncertanty of outcomes while still being high impact.
15% - to Open Philantropy - same reason as above
5% directly to the activists / advocasy groups in Russia - as i understand the environment better and know how the lives of people will be improved. i know that's not the highest impact, but i will allow myself 5% of high riskl bets close to the heart



D > B > A > C

since we are building a tech startup (a business with a tech risk and a high potential to scale quickly), we should be most interested in the market. we can asses that with the customers' willingness to pay, first and foremost. that is the biggest signal that we are building in the right area.¬†

then we need to assess TAM as that will be the first proxy to potential scale.¬†

Perfonal fit with idea is a force multiplier in all the successful startups i saw. Personal experience and interest in the industry means the founder has already the network and domain experience and will allow her to move much quicker. in a lot of cases, that's the source of "unfair advantage" the founder has over the competition.

Number of competitors per se does not tell you much. the concentration matters and the "moat" the key players have and your insights about distribution that will allow you to win the market share.¬†

having said that, depending on the industry / model we persue, there might be a number of other factors we need to evaluate (like tech readiness for the businesses with a high technological risk or opportunity for network effects for the businesses that requre these)
