Management

I served as a plaintiff in Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine & Jewish Voice for Peace v. Columbia University, advocating for fundamental free speech rights within academic institutions. This fuels my passion to build Ethica, a platform for accessible ethical tourism and economic mobility.

I grew up practicing the Shia Imami Ismaili tradition of donating 11% of my income, known as zakat in Islam. If I made $150,000, I would donate a minimum of $16,500 to charities. I would give half of that to the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), whose work in education, health, and infrastructure in emerging markets promotes sustainable, locally driven development. I would direct the remaining funds to subsidize local business owners and promote grassroots economic growth by funding microloans through Kiva. It‚Äôs important to give to charities that show measurable, scalable impact and openly redistribute wealth within local communities, rather than extract from them. I would support intentional charity models grounded in economic empowerment, long-term sustainability, and local autonomy.

These model organizations not only have proven track records, but also they show the kind of systemic, technology-driven change I hope to implement with my own venture. Kiva utilizes a digital platform to invest capital directly in underserved entrepreneurs. The AKDN, however, demonstrates the value of long-term planning and institutional investment in building solid foundations for more impact.

These models focused on redistribution deeply inform my own purpose. My philosophy is directly related to my vision as a founder: I am committed to  building innovative infrastructure that encourages self-determination at the local level. By developing technology that reduces economic leakage, local communities will flourish by retaining and growing their wealth. I am passionate about creating a high-performing, scalable venture that delivers measurable impact while also challenging entrenched inequities. To me, giving to charity is more than just a duty. It is an inherent redistribution of power and money, and a responsibility we must all uphold.

First, A. I believe personal fit with your idea is the most crucial to a successful startup because your level of expertise and passion for the subject matter gives you a unique advantage, especially while persevering through obstacles or difficult moments. Efficiency and success often come from deep passion for your work and determination to work toward a goal. My deep alignment with Ethica‚Äôs mission of ethical tourism as a means of economic redistribution drives my focus every day.

Second, C. The number of competitors in the market reveals both the strength of the existing demand, and opportunities to stand out. While the demand is not always directly correlated with direct competitors, market activity shows user interest. For my company, I‚Äôve identified clear gaps in current travel platforms that Ethica aims to solve by addressing leakage and centering local communities as core stakeholders.¬†

Third, B. Market fit is important to ensure demand for your services, but it is not everything. It is important to assess potential scale, but equally important is how you reach your customer base and how well your product resonates, regardless of market size. A high TAM is promising, but staying determined with creating a customized service is crucial. Our priority is delivering strong outcomes in the Bay Area, with the TAM anticipated to grow.¬†

Fourth, D. Demonstrated willingness to pay is important, but there are always ways to monetize customer attention over time. Initially, it is most beneficial to build a loyal and engaged customer base while having a plan for when and how to monetize. For a consumer engagement startup like Ethica, monetization relies heavily on early-stage growth.
