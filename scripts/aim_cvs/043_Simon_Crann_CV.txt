Domain Expertise, Management

After losing my father, I began a quiet writing ritual to reflect on legacy, core values and how I want to live my life as a husband, a dad, a friend, a leader. It helped me move through grief with intention and gave me clarity that shapes how I show up in the world today.

I would aim to donate at least 10% of my income annually to¬†charity. I believe in aligning giving with both impact and integrity, so I would choose a portfolio of organizations that balance evidence-based effectiveness with systemic, long-term change.

Roughly half of my giving would go to high-impact global health organizations recommended by GiveWell, such as:

Against Malaria Foundation (AMF): Distributing long-lasting insecticidal nets to prevent malaria is one of the most cost-effective, life-saving interventions available

GiveDirectly: I value its approach of providing unconditional cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty. It has strong data showing long-term benefits

The remaining half would go to organizations focused on systems change, sustainability and social entrepreneurship¬†such as:

Effective Altruism Funds (EA Infrastructure Fund or the Long-Term Future Fund): These support meta-initiatives working to strengthen the effectiveness and resilience of the philanthropic ecosystem, particularly in areas like existential risk, governance and scalable impact

Ashoka or Acumen: I deeply resonate with their belief in investing in social entrepreneurs and community-rooted solutions that rethink broken systems and create long-term value beyond aid.

Additionally, I would reserve a small portion for local or emergent needs, such as¬†grassroots climate or housing initiatives in the region where I live, to ensure that some of my giving responds to direct, place-based challenges and supports those experimenting with new models.

If I have the capacity to contribute meaningfully, then I believe I have a moral obligation to do so.

1st: (D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay 2nd:¬†(A) Personal fit with idea 3rd:¬†(B) Total addressable market 4th:¬†(C) Number of competitors in the market Demonstrated customer willingness to pay is the most important factor because it provides concrete evidence that the problem is real, urgent and worth solving. It validates that the solution addresses a genuine need and that users are willing to exchange value for it.¬†  
Personal fit with the idea comes next because early-stage startups demand resilience. Founders inevitably face rejection, ambiguity and long hours, so alignment with the mission and personal values is essential. A strong personal fit fuels perseverance and meaningful storytelling, which strengthen the venture's chances of success.  

Total addressable market (TAM) is important, but only once the core value is proven. Many great businesses start in a niche and expand later. An initially small TAM shouldn't be disqualifying if the startup solves a painful problem well. It can evolve as the team learns. I prioritize depth of demand before scale of opportunity.  

Number of competitors in the market is the least important to me. A competitive market can signal demand. Differentiation often comes from positioning, delivery or insight. I‚Äôd rather enter a crowded space with a compelling angle and real traction than a blue ocean with no clear demand.  

strong startups emerge from the intersection of real problems, committed founders and validated learning. That‚Äôs the mindset I would bring to evaluating ideas.
