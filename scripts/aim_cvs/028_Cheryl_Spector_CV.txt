Domain Expertise, Management

Our Business Improvement District has not achieved operating directives for years. I did a survey and a petition for our community to object the10-Year Renewal. Results: Creation of a Community Advisory Board, President of the Board stepped down, and Community Benefits Agreement being created.

Raising funds for mission-aligned real estate - Angel investors, recruit individuals to invest in a social mission-based fund- creating a community of guarantors

Ignoring taxes, of the $150,000, I would donate $75,000.

$25,000 to Center for Democratic and Environmental Rights – Help their work in shifting common human perception of nature to understand it as a Living Entity by giving nature legal rights(combats destruction of natural living environment and beings)

$25,000 to C40 Cities – impactful local leaders (Mayors) united globally to implement equitable, thriving climate-focused communities, phasing out fossil fuels with high-impact accelerators and foster innovation (local leaders with power to change how cities operate, fund contracts, treat their citizens)

$25,000 to Sundance Institute – Fosters discovery and development of independent artists and audiences - culture leaders.  Storytelling- movies best way to get a message out, educate, inform while entertaining but collaborative events and opportunities for the public to engage, shift their thinking, actions and engage in change

1. (A) Personal fit with idea. Person leading needs to be in love with the problem they are trying to solve (not necessarily the exact solution they are proposing at the moment)- ensures long-term engagement and eventually finding the “right” solution.

2. (D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay. There needs to be a “need” being met and evidence that customers will pay (and how much) for this “x”-without a solid customer base, there are no sales, no way to continue to fund this start-up-    Need to understand why they will pay for it- 

3. (B) Total addressable market. Need to know what type of market (niche?), how large, buy once or multiple times, recurring need, growth potential, spin-off

4. (C) Number of competitors in the market. Understand if you are one in a million or five, what sets you apart from your competitors, number of competitors- influence marketing, pricing and /or form collaborations
