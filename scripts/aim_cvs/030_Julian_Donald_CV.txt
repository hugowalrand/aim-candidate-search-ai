Domain Expertise, Management

I am particularly proud of the voluntary peer support work I have done, helping other former international aid workers to reintegrate back into their home countries and deal with their PTSD.

I raised corporate investment for a pilot new media company developing integrated TV/internet/merchandising in the early 2000s. I researched potential investors, contacted them, and led negotiations.

I have taken the 10% pledge, so I would donate at least $15,000, more as possible. I would donate the majority of that, $10k, to GiveWell's All Grants Fund; I follow and generally trust their analysis and appreciate the higher potential impact (and accept the higher potential risk) of this fund vs. the Top Charities Fund. Of the remaining $5k, I would give $4k to M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (from my personal history, I am intimately aware of their effectiveness) and $1k to local causes, particularly the local food bank which seems to be the most cost-effective community donation option.

First, (B) Total addressable market. I am most interested in founding for potential scale of impact, regardless of the risk. A $100 billion idea with a 0.001% chance of success is still a better risk than a $1 million idea with a 100% chance of success.

Second, (C) Number of competitors, although the raw number may be less important than what can be learned about their effectiveness and ambition. If a market has a large number of potential competitors who are not aggressively pursuing growth, I would suggest that represents an opportunity, not a barrier.

Third, (D) Customer willingness. The right marketing strategy (or partnerships) can change willingness; there were two decades of failed attempts to market a tablet computer before Apple released the iPad. Of potentially greater importance in emerging markets is ability to pay; an analysis of potential profit margins must be ruthlessly practical.

Finally, (A). My career has been largely defined by doing (new) things that most other people do not or will not do; I am not married to any particular cause or industry, although I have much more experience in some than others.
