Domain Expertise

I founded a school project to support refugees at the Serbian-Macedonian border by organizing donation drives and community engagement. The initiative was honored with the KICK Prize (City of M√ºnster) and the Willi-Graf Prize for social commitment.

Crowdfunding for initiative.

If I earned $150,000 USD per year, I would donate around 10% ($15,000) to high-impact, transparent organizations. These would include GiveWell-recommended charities like Against Malaria Foundation, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res for medical aid in crises, and local refugee education programs‚Äîcauses I deeply care about and have supported through past volunteer work.

Ranking:

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay
(A) Personal fit with idea
(B) Total addressable market
(C) Number of competitors in the market

Reasoning: The clearest sign of a viable startup is whether people are willing to pay for the solution‚Äî(D) is direct market validation and the strongest predictor of traction. Next, (A) matters because a founder‚Äôs deep connection to the problem ensures long-term resilience and credibility, especially through inevitable pivots. While (B) is important for scaling, even a smaller market can yield success if the fit is strong and the need is urgent. Lastly, (C) matters less early on‚Äîcompetition validates demand, and what matters more is differentiation, not simply presence of other players.
