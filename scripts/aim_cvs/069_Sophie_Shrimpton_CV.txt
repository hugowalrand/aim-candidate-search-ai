Management

I organised a group of law students to lobby for LGBTQIA+ policy reform in the 2020 New Zealand election. We assessed political parties against a checklist of 'dream' policies. Labour adopted the full list, won the election and implemented the policies (e.g., ban on conversion therapy)

N/A

$15K PY (10%) until I own a home, then at least $50-100K PY (1/3-2/3) after that, depending on cost of living, existing savings and investments.

My donation philosophy is based on: 1/3 in QALY optimised healthcare interventions. I would follow advice of EA and select Malaria Consortium ($4,500 / life saved)

2/3 in 'moonshot' / structural investment in AI-based human biology tools to (a) accelerate transition to personalised, preventative healthcare model which can actually adequately address chronic, complex disease (AI required to accelerate both drug development and scale up clinician care) (b) moonshot towards significant increases in longevity (to maximise QALYs added). For the latter, I would follow the advice of Longevity Pledge (Alex Zhavoronkov) and invest in Insilico Medicine (AI drug discovery). This is not a charity, however it is necessary to invest in a for-profit as there aren't effective not-for-profits in this space currently. Despite it being a for-profit, it will likely have significant impact in increasing longevity far beyond any current not-for-profit given the acceleration and personalisation of drug discovery

(D) > (B) > (C) > (A)

I chose this order because:

(D) is necessary for initial sales to be viable. If you don't have any customers who are willing to pay for your product or service, then you will not make it off the ground from the start. No matter how large the potential market, how unsaturated it is, or your personal passion, you will not be able to tap into that potential without people being willing to purchase what you are offering at its price point (Note: I reading D as meaning if D is not present then the cost of producing your product / service, therefore your necessary price point, is higher than the willingness to pay)

(B) is necessary to expand beyond a successful but small start-up. A market needs to be large enough to produce significant revenues that will maximise donations made. You can have the the remaining two factors in your favour, but if the market is tiny, scale is limited from the outset. You will end up with a successful but small start-up, which defeats the purpose

(C) > (A) I don't believe personal fit / passion should be a key driver of your actions in the world, but the focus should be the outcome of your actions. You should consider a market advantage such as level of saturation over any personal feelings.
