Startup Experience

Bringing up 6 ophan kids and giving them future.

Rescue a sick poor Mother of 4 boys and giving them hope and love.

Raising my three Kids alone  in a foreign land. 

he funding was secured through angel investors. My role was to research potential investors, prepare the pitch deck, and present our startup’s vision and financial plan. I also helped negotiate the investment terms and coordinated follow-up communications with interested investors.

f I earned $150,000 per year, I would donate 5% ($7,500) annually. I would give $4,000 to GiveDirectly, which provides unconditional cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty, and $3,500 to PATH, which focuses on affordable vaccines and global health innovations. I chose these organizations because they have proven, measurable impact and align with my commitment to improving health and reducing poverty

I ranked demonstrated customer willingness to pay first because validating actual demand is essential for a startup’s survival. Total addressable market comes second because the idea’s potential is limited if the market is too small. Personal fit with the idea is next, as alignment improves execution and motivation but cannot compensate for lack of demand. Finally, the number of competitors is least important; a crowded market can still be entered successfully with a strong product and strategy.
