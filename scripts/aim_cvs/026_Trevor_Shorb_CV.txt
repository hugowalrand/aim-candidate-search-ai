How much I would donate: 5%  
My reasoning: I would like to give away as much of my salary as I can over my lifetime within the constraints of my portfolio of life needs. While I would ideally like to give away a higher percentage now, I expect my income to go up over the course of my career and I expect to take risks with the potential for high upside outcomes, such as founding multiple businesses, investing, and pursuing high-paying roles in traditional business. I expect future donations to have a lower personal cost due to higher income and financial stability. That said, the marginal dollar donated with be much cheaper in the future and in the present I am choosing to allocate those marginal dollars to living in a high cost of living city (NYC) for career opportunities and network, supporting a family, and investing in index and retirement funds.¬†

Who I would donate to: EA Funds and Giving What We Can funds  
My reasoning:¬†  
1. Expert decision-making: I want to outsource decision-making around how to best cost-effectively allocate my donation to experts aligned with my values.  
2. Values-aligned: By choosing these funds associated with effective altruism, I know they are values aligned--they prioritize cost effectiveness, expected value, and transparency, among other things.  
3. Diversify my donations by cause area and funder: Funds offer a chance for funders to allocate dollars more effectively by ensuring they go where they are most needed--they are more familiar with organization's needs at the time, for example. These funds both also diversify the causes to which they donate across important cause areas. Finally, by splitting my donations across two funds, I further diversify my donation dollars to hedge against my uncertainty in the relative effectiveness of each fund.¬†

1. D. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

2. B. Total addressable market

3. C. Number of competitors



4. A. Personal fit with idea



#1 - D. I would rank customer WTP first because I think it offers the best indication of a real need and how much addressing it is worth. The more data on WTP, the better you can evaluate the feasibility of a potential business model.¬†

#2 - B. I would rank TAM second because it gives an idea of the potential for growth for a startup. If this is too small, the startups growth prospects may be inherently limited and one should reconsider the target market. This is by no means the only factor to consider, and it is difficult to estimate accurately, but it is important for determining if the market is generally promising or to be avoided.¬†¬†

#3 - C. The number of competitors is most relevant when the number is 0 or quite high. Much more important is who the competitors are and what their market share is, e.g., is it Amazon or is it a fragmented group of SMEs?¬†

#4 - A. Personal fit is important to me, but it is not more important than the above three factors because I would not pursue a startup that is not able to scale, not addressing a customer need, or in the wrong market simply because the idea is a good fit for me.
