Startup Experience

I‚Äôm proud of having grown up across three countries: Singapore, India and the UK. It taught me to adapt quickly, connect with different cultures and stay open-minded. It‚Äôs been a big part of how I‚Äôve learned to navigate change and build relationships with all kinds of people.

I haven‚Äôt been involved in any commercial fundraising yet, as most of my work so far has been in research, nonprofits, and idea-stage projects. That said, I‚Äôm excited to learn and grow in this area, and I‚Äôd love to gain hands-on experience through this program.

If I earned $150,000 USD a year, I would aim to donate at least 10 percent of it, so around $15,000. That feels like a good starting point. It‚Äôs enough to do real good without being overwhelming, and I would hope to increase that over time as I became more financially comfortable.

When I first learned about malaria prevention during a fellowship workshop, I was honestly shocked that something as simple as a bed net, costing just a few dollars, could save a life. I remember thinking, how is this not talked about more? That moment really stuck with me. Since then, I have felt that donating to something like GiveWell‚Äôs Maximum Impact Fund makes a lot of sense. It‚Äôs one of the most data-backed ways I‚Äôve seen to directly help people.

At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure about longtermism. It seemed a bit abstract and hard to act on. I wasn‚Äôt convinced we could meaningfully do good for people so far in the future. But after reading The Precipice and doing policy work in areas like AI governance and biosecurity, I started to see that risks to future generations are real and that our actions now matter more than I originally thought. I wouldn‚Äôt put all my giving into that space, but I would definitely want to contribute to something like the Long-Term Future Fund.

I also care a lot about helping people figure out how they can contribute to doing good in the world. I‚Äôve personally benefited from mentorship and community programs that helped me find more clarity and direction, especially in EA spaces. So I would want to support infrastructure that helps others do the same, whether through career advising, fellowships, or research grants.

Lastly, I think I would want part of my giving to feel personal. Something like GiveDirectly or Fortify Health appeals to me because it‚Äôs grounded in dignity and agency. I appreciate knowing that people can use that support however they see fit, and in the case of Fortify Health, there‚Äôs a connection to communities in India that makes it feel even more real to me.

I know my giving choices will probably shift over time. I plan to keep learning, stay open to new evidence, and make adjustments as I grow. For me, giving is not about being perfect or always having the best answer. It‚Äôs about trying, staying honest, and doing what I can to make life a little better for others.

If I had to rank these four factors, I would put personal fit with the idea first. I have found that when I genuinely care about a problem, I bring more energy, patience, and creativity to solving it. For example, when I worked on a capstone project exploring antibiotic accessibility in low and middle-income countries, I stayed committed far longer than I expected. It was not the flashiest or most marketable idea, but I believed deeply in its importance. Even after the course ended, I kept reading and refining the work because I felt responsible for it in a personal way. That kind of connection gives me the motivation to keep going when things are difficult or unclear.

Next, I would rank demonstrated customer willingness to pay. This is a practical and honest signal that the solution has real value. It does not have to mean immediate revenue or a polished product, but even early signs that someone would pay to solve this problem suggest you are building something useful. In the beginning stages, that kind of feedback helps reduce guesswork and keeps the idea grounded in reality.

I would put total addressable market third. Scale is important, especially when thinking about long-term impact, but I do not think it should be the deciding factor early on. Sometimes a smaller, underserved market is where you can build the most meaningful relationships, test ideas quickly, and eventually expand. I care more about who is being helped and how much difference it makes, rather than how many people might hypothetically be reached someday.

Finally, I would place number of competitors last. I used to think that fewer competitors meant a better opportunity, but I have changed my mind about that. Now I see competition as a possible sign that the problem is worth working on. What matters more is whether we are offering a distinct approach or value. In fields like public health or AI policy, I have seen multiple actors working side by side on different angles of the same challenge. That can be healthy and even collaborative if done thoughtfully.

In the end, I believe a strong personal connection, a clear early signal of usefulness, and a realistic but meaningful scope are what help an idea become both resilient and impactful. Those are the kinds of ideas I would be excited to build and stay committed to over time.
