Domain Expertise, Management

A personal journey to understand my late AuDHD diagnosis and mental health challenges reframed my noisy brain as a creative, pattern-spotting asset.

I now explore how human potential drives social change, sustainability and ethical business.

I'm proud to turn insight into practical, inclusive action.



Local Authority Grants. British Business Bank Startup Loan. Friends and Family investment..

Right now, I‚Äôd split my giving - around 10% of my salary - between:

  

The Difference (UK) ‚Äî transforming outcomes for excluded and vulnerable children through inclusive education.

  

Inside Out (UK) ‚Äî supporting care leavers to become entrepreneurs, changing both perception and opportunity.

  

Autistica ‚Äî advancing research and practical support for neurodivergent people, especially in employment.

Ranking: B > D > A > C

  

1. Total Addressable Market (B):

If we want system change, we need system reach. Big problems need big markets - especially those underserved or overlooked.

  

2. Willingness to Pay (D):

Intent is cheap. If people pay - with money, time, or effort - it shows the idea actually matters.

  

3. Personal Fit (A):

Lived experience helps, but obsession with outcomes beats identity alignment. Purpose can emerge from traction.

  

4. Competitors (C):

Too many founders fear competition. I see it as a sign of relevance - and an opportunity to do it better.
