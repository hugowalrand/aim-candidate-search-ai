I‚Äôm proud of receiving the Billion Acts Award, being the first Dominican to win HackCorruption, and being recognized among the Top 20 SDG Digital Changemakers by ITU. These milestones reflect both my personal resilience and my commitment to driving global impact through innovation.

I have successfully raised over **\$30,000 USD** in grant funding from organizations such as Accountability Lab, BCIE, the EU and German Embassy, Citi Foundation, and the Billion Acts Awards. My role involved leading proposals, pitching projects, and securing support to scale social impact initiatives.

If my earnings were $150k per year, I would feel comfortable donating around 10% (continued ballpark, but for my example, around $15,000) of my income. I like linking donating to an income level because as I would earn more I would be able to donate a larger amount.¬†

I would try to divide it between a few orgs, but two prime candidates are GiveWell-recommended charities or Accountability Lab.

I would donate the larger chunk of the $15k (probably around $12,000) to top effective charities that GiveWell has recommended (e.g., GiveDirectly or Against Malaria Foundation). There is a lot of evidence to support these types of charities by giving people money to save lives or make a change in their lives, and that is much more important to me than donating to charities and projects that not substantiated with evidence.

I would donate the other remaining $3,000 to the Accountability Lab. I like their emphasis on governance and anti-corruption initiatives, as I see that as a ways to tackle root of the problems and find solutions, rather than just symptoms. I like the idea of supporting local activists and finding ways to build at least more accountability in these institutions and municipal governments creates the potential for lasting, systemic changes in some communities.

Ranking (most to least important)

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay.

(A) Personal fit with the idea.

(B) Total addressable market (TAM).

(C) Number of competitors in the market.

Reasoning:

My rationale is based on the tenets of modern entrepreneurship and the "Lean Startup" method, which advocates for evidence-based proof and pivoting instead of business models. While in a programme your goal is not to write the best business plan, it is to de-risk the idea as quickly and efficiently as possible.
