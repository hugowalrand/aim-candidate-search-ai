My passion for community-driven projects. Organizing street feeding programs around my community to help in the rehabilitation of street children to mentorship. Currently, I am volunteering with Mentor International to support girls from underserved communities with technology skills and mentorship

I raised approximately $574 USD (KES 57,377) for the Streetlove Project, combining both direct funds and in-kind donations. While it wasn't commercial fundraising, it was raised through grassroots crowdfunding and community mobilization.It gave me practical exposure to mobilizing support and organizing grassroots inititives.

Sticking to my commitment of giving 10% of what I have earned, that is what I will do with the USD 150,000, out of which I will use the saving rule (50,30,20). This is how I will direct the funds
50%- Ngong Road Children‚Äôs Foundation (NRCF)¬†Closest to heart is giving back to one organization that transformed my life by allowing me¬†access to education, mentorship, and dignity opportunities that shaped me to who I am today and the achievements I have had so far. As a beneficiary of the program, I am a living testimony of how impactful their program is. I would give back to ensure more children benefit the way I did.
30% - Mentor International I am currently volunteering with this incredible project, which aims at bridging the digital gap in marginalized and rural communities by empowering girls with technology skills, mentorship, and career opportunities. Through hands-on training, industry partnerships, and a supportive community, we aim to equip the women with the tools they need to innovate, lead, and create lasting impact in their communities.¬†Supporting this initiative allows me to empower the next generation of women in STEM and create pathways out of poverty.
20%- to local children‚Äôs homes and street outreach projects ‚Äì I would contribute to feeding programs and support informal shelters that provide care and dignity to vulnerable children. These are often underfunded but make an immediate, tangible difference.  
    This also includes projects around climate, data and sustainable development from grassroot communities that are making an impact in shaping the world

(A) Personal fit with idea- this is the most important, its the dream that gives the founder motivation, drive resilience to keep on working on the project till its fruition. Understanding and owning a projects helps one to stick with the project even in the initial stages full of uncertainties, lower return on the investment.

    *   (D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay- a great idea must meet market demands. Willingness of people to pay for a product¬† shows long-term sustainability of the project

    *   (B) Total addressable market much as this may be important the need for a product might be better than a market size. I am working on an E-Waste project currently while the market may appear small today, the growth in digital devices, regulatory shifts (like EPR policies), and demand for ethical recycling all point toward a rapidly expanding opportunity in future for Kenya. Startups like mine can help shape this market by building both the tech and the ecosystem to support it. Similar is the drone Industry

    *   (C) Number of competitors in the market While competitors may affect startups , they play a role in helping the startup understand the gaps yet to be filled and the potential areas of partnership. Taking a look at the E-Waste Sector the amount of electronic waste being generated per year vs the amount being produced and what is being recycled looking at established companies may discourage my project. Instead of focusing on how many people are in the market I am looking at how can I intergrate and bring together this players to help solve and create an effective electronic waste management that is free for all. Another area is drones although there are several players in the field that does not mean they are enough to meet the needs
