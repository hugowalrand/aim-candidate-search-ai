Domain Expertise, Startup Experience

I taught my daughter, Rowan (who is 8), to meditate when she was 2. Earlier this year, she was invited to a residential meditation retreat, usually reserved for adults, after meeting a teacher who had just offered one in our hometown, Austin. Meditation is the best investment I have made for Rowan.

I have not raised funding for my company -- it has been self-funded.

Let's start with some rough mathematics (taking into account United States taxes):

  

Gross income: $150,000

Standard deduction: $14,600 (The standard deduction is the amount US taxpayers can deduct from gross income to reduce their taxable income)

Taxable income: $135,400

Tax (based on current US tax brackets): $29,042

Net Income: $150000-$29042 = $120,958

  

I would love to say that I would give a substantial portion away, but I have not done so in the past. So, it would be disingenuous of me to claim that I would suddenly do it now. Learning about Founding to Give has made me pause and think, as has fatherhood and my evolving meditation practice. As such, I often think about my contribution to society at large -- people beyond myself and my close family. Admittedly, there's a bit of a psychological hump I still need to overcome -- once I do that, I'd contribute 30% (i.e., approximately $36,000) of the net income calculated above.¬†

  

Over the last few years, a couple organizations have tugged at my heartstrings:

  



Love146: https://love146.org/



They provide care to survivors of child sex trafficking, and educate youth (and adults) to prevent trafficking from happening.¬†

  



Jhamtse Gatsal: https://jhamtse.org/



They are a housing community and school for children who have been orphaned or whose parents are unable to care for them (due to poverty or mental health reasons).¬†

  

Why these two organization? First, some background may help -- I volunteered with a domestic violence and sexual assault prevention organization many years ago when I was in my 20s. My friends, who were mostly my age, seemed perplexed at how strongly I felt about the cause. For me, children, women and men being raped or coerced to have sex feels like an extremely heinous act at a visceral level. Before that, when I was a teenager, I developed a strong interest in animal welfare and eventually stopped eating meat because I couldn't justify the cruelty of killing to satiate my taste buds. I'm currently in a mentorship program providing guidance for a 17-year-old Venezuelan boy whose family has been granted asylum in the United States.¬†

  

What's in common between my background experiences and the two organizations mentioned above is my soft spot for the vulnerable and (in some cases) the defenseless. Both Love146 and Jhamtse Gatsal are helping children with their physical, psychological and emotional safety -- something they may not receive otherwise. In fact, it could be worse -- they might potentially get exploited for being vulnerable and defenseless. I find the work of these organizations incredibly compassionate and compelling.¬†

  

Admittedly, I have not performed any quantitative analysis of the impact of these organizations. In the past, our family has made small donations (100s to low 1000s of dollars) to various organizations. But, to donate $36,000 (or, potentially a lot more if an entrepreneurial endeavor succeeds), I would take into account other measures of impact before making a final decision to give. 

I would rank the four as follows from most important to least:

  

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

A business is not viable without paying customers, so this is the most important factor -- this would determine the proverbial product-market fit. Also, it is important to understand the customer profile deeply so as not to try to be "everything to everyone". Founders that have lived experience in the domain are more likely to understand the customers than ones without such experience. It is also incredibly important to evolve with the paying customers' needs (for example, Blackberry famously became complacent and lost market share).¬†

  

(A) Personal fit with idea¬†

I think of this as passion -- when one's passionate about something, they can be expected to give it their all. An absence of passion could work, but the risk goes up. It is very important for the founder(s) and the early hires to be connect and care about the idea, domain and customers. For example, I know someone who couldn't find a doctor after (or, perhaps during) a trip and ended up founding a doctors-patients marketplace called Zocdoc.

  

(C) Number of competitors in the market¬†

Having competition is a good thing -- it might indicate the existence of a actual market and incentivize all players to raise the bar of their respective products and/or services being offered. Having no competition could be an ominous sign, whereas having too many (for example, there are a lot of professionals selling real estate in the US) might indicate that the market suffers from fragmentation.¬†

  

(B) Total addressable market¬†

Unless the TAM is incredibly concentrated (for example, I know the founder of Zelus Analytics whose clients are professional sports teams in the US), this is likely not that most important metric. Also, the existence of a large TAM and having the desire to "capture just 1% of it" is not a good strategy to follow if the first two factors above are not addressed well. Finally, the investors will care about TAM so the founders should of course be aware of and educated about it.
