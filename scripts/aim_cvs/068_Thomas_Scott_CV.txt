Domain Expertise, Management

Outside of my career I founded a UK registered charity that aims to improve educational outcomes for vulnerable children and young adults in Uganda. We have raised over £250,000 that has facilitated 1,900 years of education and provided 40,000 nutritious meals to children as they attended school.

I have raised over £250,000 towards the charity I founded. This was mainly from trusts, foundation and corporate donations (~80%) with the remaining mainly coming from individual donations via our website / fundraising events.

I would donate 10% of of this salary to highly cost-effective charities. I would split this donation into equal parts and give it to the world’s most effective non-profit organisations as per GiveWell and Giving What We Can. This is a strategy I am currently engaged in having taken the Giving What We Can Pledge in April 2020.

Knowing that all the charities that Giving What We Can and GiveWell recommends are highly cost-effective, I then have a choice as to which organisations I support in this area. As a neartermist, I care deeply about helping those living in extreme poverty and in alleviating preventable mortality. And this is where personal preference comes in. I simply choose the causes in this area that I want to support. At present, through the Giving What We Can website this includes, and is split by percentage as below:

- GiveWell (All Grants Fund) – 12%

- GiveWell (Top Charities Fund) – 11%

- Malaria Consortium (Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention) – 11%

- Against Malaria Foundation – 11%

- Helen Keller International (Vitamin A Supplementation) – 11%

- New Incentives (Childhood Immunisation Incentives) – 11%

- Giving What We Can (Global Health and Wellbeing Fund) – 11%

- Founders Pledge (Global Health & Development Fund) – 11%

- Effective Altruism Funds (Global Health & Development Fund) – 11%

I would rank the factors in the following order of importance, from top (most important) to bottom (least important):

(B) – Total addressable market

As when we think about doing good, the scale of the problem is of upmost importance. What’s the magnitude of the problem we’re trying to solve? How does it affect people and how many peoples does it affect? The bigger the problem the larger the market and the higher the chance of success.

(C) – Number of competitors in the market

In Zero to One, Peter Thiel talks about the benefits of monopolies. He argues that truly great companies don’t take horizontal steps, they aim for vertical progress creating an utterly new technology or method, something that can’t be copied. If you have no competitors and you create something that people value, the chances of success greatly increase. However, if it is a tiny market with only a few customers, it will mean little. This is why this comes second to total addressable market.

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

Simply having a good idea isn’t enough. It is pointless creating the perfect product that no-one is willing to pay for. If customers aren’t willing to pay for it, the idea doesn’t have commercial viability. The purpose of the founding to give programme is to make a profit to donate to the world’s most effective nonprofit organisations. If there is no commercial viability there is no profit and there is no donation.

(A)   Personal fit with the idea

I believe I have the skills and experience to start a business and bring a great idea to life. When it comes to the idea, I am agnostic, I believe the above three factors are far more important in predicting the success of a company I found. I want to take my ego and interests out of the equation and objectively choose the best idea that has the best commercial viability or the greatest expected value; What are the chances of success and how good would success be for each idea? I want to use the analytical, critical, rigorous and empirical thinking found in the scientific sector to help me choose the idea that I work on.
