I'll admit- it's a little tricky for me to answer this question in a way that is both authentic and makes me feel as though I'm representing the kind of spirit that you're trying to cultivate in this program.

Because the truth is that I've made more than $150k/year gross for a while and have been averaging a donation rate of 

In ascending order of importance:

4. (C) Number of competitors in the market

I wouldn't place too much stock in this. A market with many many competitors can indicate that no one has quite figured out how to execute well. A market with little competition may have entrenched players. In that case, I'd want a clear thesis as to why we think we could outcompete them with, but that's not unreasonable (see: the innovator's dilemma).



3. (B) Total addressable market





A market that's too small to sustain a business (or draw requisite funding) would be a deal-breaker. Beyond that, I don't think it matters too much. Whenever I hear a pitch in the style of "if we corner just 1% of this giant market" I roll my eyes, because I think it tends to incorrectly presume that a small market share of a very large market is somehow easily attainable.

2. (A) Personal fit with idea

A startup is a big commitment, so I'd like to make sure I'm picking an endeavor that I believe in and suites my skillset. Plus: having a good founder-market fit narrative can be helpful in getting funding

  



1. (D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay



Market validation is the difference between an idea for a piece of software that could exist and a plan for building an actual company. I imagine most of my time/effort spent evaluating startup ideas would be discovering whether customers are willing to pay for stuff as quickly as possible (a la the Lean Startup)
