Startup Experience

I passed my medical licensing exams on the first try, whilst actively dealing with newly-diagnosed anxiety and depression

If I earned $150,000 USD per year, I would commit to donating at least 10% of my income ($15,000 annually) to organizations that have proven their ability to improve lives at scale. My donation priorities would focus on global health, mental health access and cost-effective interventions that mostly¬†¬†target underserved populations.

  

I would divide the donation as follows:

  

StrongMind ($6,000-$7,000)

  

This is a nonprofit providing group-based talk therapy for women and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, especially Uganda and Zambia. It treats depression using a low-cost, community-led model and has demonstrated improvements in both mental health and economic outcomes. The cost per person treated is relatively low, and their work addresses both individual suffering and systemic gender inequity.

  

Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) ($8,000 - $9,000)

AMF distributes long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets in regions with high malaria burden. Bed nets are one of the most cost-effective interventions in global health. AMF stands out for its transparency, rigorous data collection, and commitment to ensuring nets reach those who need them most.

  

I would want my donations to directly reduce unnecessary suffering and improve life chances for those with the fewest resources. Global health inequalities, such as those driven by preventable diseases like malaria (which I see on a daily basis in my medical practice) are quite urgent and solvable problems, especially when effective interventions exist.

  

In addition to these global health charities, I would also try to allocate a smaller portion (e.g., $1,000‚Äì$2,000) annually to local or regional organisations in my community or country at large (Nigeria), especially those working on mental health access, women‚Äôs health, or early childhood development.

Ranking:

1.  (A) Personal fit with idea

2.  (D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

3.  (B) Total addressable market

4.  (C) Number of competitors in the market

  

1. Personal fit with idea (Most important)

  

I believe that founder‚Äìidea fit is the most important factor in evaluating a startup‚Äôs potential, especially at the earliest stages. A strong personal connection, whether through lived experience, expertise in the domain, or authentic interest can potentially sustain the founder through the inevitable challenges of building something new. This is because it often leads to deeper insight into the user‚Äôs needs, more resilient motivation, and stronger storytelling.

  

For example, my time working in under-resourced hospitals and digital mental health startups in Nigeria revealed both the barriers and cultural sensitivities involved in care delivery, insight I would never have fully grasped from the outside. This kind of connection to the problem is what helps ideas evolve into real solutions that people trust and use.

  

  

2. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

  

Even the best ideas with perfect founder alignment still need validation from the market. Demonstrated willingness to pay (even in small testable ways like pre-orders, waitlists, or paid pilots) shows that demand exists, as opposed to just verbal interest. It‚Äôs the clearest early signal that I‚Äôm building something people want, and that my solution has actual utility or value.

  

  

3. Total addressable market (TAM)

  

TAM is important for long-term scalability, but in the earliest stages of a startup, obsessing over market size can be misleading. A lot of breakthrough startups began in what seemed like small or niche markets and expanded into much larger ones (for example Amazon with books). If a problem is painful and specific enough, TAM can grow organically over time. This makes me see it as a useful indicator of long-term ceiling, not immediate potential.

  

4. Number of competitors in the market

  

This is the least important in my opinion, as competition is often a sign of demand. A crowded market can actually validate that a real need exists. What usually matters more than the number of competitors is the ability of the team to differentiate, through better UX, unique positioning, faster execution, or underserved segments.
