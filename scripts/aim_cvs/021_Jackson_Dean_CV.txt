I organized a Mr. Beast "Stay in the circle" game for a group of friends and acquaintances.

A 12 hour 10 person "boredom competition" where participants had to remain in a circle on my driveway that shrank over time. It turned out to be an absolute blast!

N/A

I would donate 20% ($30k), primarily to x/s-risk reduction and adjacent groups.

This would likely be Longview Philanthropy for the following reasons:



I am drawn to x-risk reduction through a "figure out the really high risk pressing problems first, then deal with the animals / global health / other problems afterwards."

With regards to AI risks specifically:

if we "solve" the various AI problems first, everything else may become easier to fix afterwards because we have powerful AI tools / collaborators to help.
If we fail to solve the AI problems (and one of the catastrophic AI scenarios plays out), then nothing really matters anymore
If AI fizzles and the catastrophic scenarios do not play out, I will still have been glad to have treated it seriously

Longview is recommended by Giving What We Can.¬†

I trust the recommendations of GWWC

I have worked with Longview before as a grantee and appreciate their values and rigor in their grant evaluations
$30k is not so large a number that I would want to have significant personal involvement in deciding where the money goes. My threshold for that is likely ~$100k/year



In order: A, D, B, C

1. Personal fit with the idea

I subscribe to Derek Sivers' idea that ‚ÄúIdeas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier.

Execution is worth millions.‚Äù

Executing well on the idea matters much more than the idea itself. So while one idea might be weaker in other aspects compared to another, if you are more personally able / willing / excited to execute on a particular idea, that would create much more final success.

  

2. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

It doesn't matter how great the thing you build is if no one is willing to pay for it.

3. Total addressable market

I think this goes closely in hand with number of competitors and quality of competitors.

My favorite example of this is blue collar small businesses like plumbers. If a city is large relative to the number of plumbers, it is easy for a new plumber to pull enough business to be viable, without significantly affecting the existing plumbers.

But for a small city that cannot support more than a few, it would be extremely difficult for a new plumber to pull enough business to survive, and if they did, an existing plumber would likely be forced out.

4. Number of competitors

See above.

But also the quality of competitors is extremely important. If a new entrant can improve on the offerings of all the rest, it does not necessarily matter how many competitors there are. (Barring switching costs away from existing solutions)
