Mobile Development, Frontend Development, DevOps, LLM/AI, Domain Expertise, Management

I'm proud of my 10 years of volunteer work with Running Start, a nonpartisan nonprofit that trains young women to run for political office. It’s been inspiring to contribute to a movement that empowers the next generation of public servants.

Since I’m currently investing in my startup and living in Washington, DC, I wouldn’t feel comfortable donating a large amount to charity until I had a solid financial cushion for both personal and business needs. Once I’m in a stable position, I would donate $3,000 to Running Start, reflecting my long-standing commitment to empowering young women in politics. I’d give $4,000 to the Malala Fund, whose global work in girls’ education aligns with my values. I’d also contribute $2,000 to Detroit Keep Growing, my family is from Detroit, and I deeply respect the city’s revitalization efforts. The organization offers a sustainable solution to what was once a major food desert, and I believe in the power of community-driven change. Lastly, I’d set aside $1,000 for disaster relief throughout the year, so I can respond to urgent needs as they arise.

1\\\. Total Addressable Market - The first and most important factor confirming there is real, sizable market and actual problem to solve. 

3. Personal Fit with the Idea - As a founder,  I have to care deeply about the problem or have skills needed to solve the problem have to align with my background.

2. Demonstrated Customer Willingness to Pay - Even if the market is large and personal alignment is strong, it’s imperative to know that customers are willing to pay for the proposed solution.

4. Number of Competitors in the Market - While this is worth researching and analyzing, it’s the least important to me. A crowded market can still be a great opportunity if I bring a unique perspective, model, or execution strategy. In fact, competition could indicate demand. I'd be more concerned about the quality of competition. There's aren't many "blue oceans" and oceans don't stay blue for long.
