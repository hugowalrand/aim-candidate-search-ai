I recently climbed Mt. Rainier amidst tough conditions (white-out blizzard, 50+mph winds, and changing routes due to icefall). Half of our group turned back at midway point (Camp Muir) and even more turned back later on. The guides weren't sure I'd make it but I surprised them with my resilience :)

One of them was startup seed funding through an accelerator that I enabled with my connections through hackathons and college programs. Another set of funds was for a nonprofit through foundation/fellowship grants that I directly applied for.

I would first determine how much I need to live comfortably, meaning all my recurring expenses, investments, emergency fund contributions, etc. are taken care of. After subtracting that amount and taxes from $150k, I'd donate the rest. The organization I'd donate to would have to be both ambitious and effective. Ambition is less tangible but could include things like intentions, motivations, and vision. Effectiveness is more easily measurable with metrics such as lives saved, diseases prevented, etc., as relevant to the organization. An example of an effective organization with an ambitious mission is Against Malaria.

A>C>B>D

A) If I'm not hugely passionate about the idea and don't feel a fit, I'm not likely to commit the time or energy required. I also feel that if I'm passionate about the idea or cause, I'm willing to persevere longer, sacrifice more, and fight harder.

C) Once I'm passionate about something, I think the next factor to consider is how saturated the market is. If there are many competitors, perhaps the idea is not novel or it'll be harder to penetrate that market. If there are few competitors, then perhaps the idea is more unique but the market has higher barriers to entry. Either way, the number of competitors will provide some insights into tradeoffs that might need to be made.¬†

B) Then, I'd consider the market size; if the size of the market is very small, there's potentially less opportunity for impact. However, it could be that the market is small now but is growing and could be really big in the future due to industry trends. Or the market could be huge already allowing for outsized impact now.¬†

D) Lastly, the proof of viability of a product is revenue. If people aren't willing to pay for something, then the idea probably needs refinement. I'd consider this last because competition and market size is easier to assess with less effort. Assessing customer willingness to pay requires more effort (early prototype or concept formation, time to survey, etc.) and could be a wasted effort if the above items raise any red flags.
