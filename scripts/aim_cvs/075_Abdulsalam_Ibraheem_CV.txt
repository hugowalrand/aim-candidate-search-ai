DevOps, LLM/AI, Startup Experience

I was part of the founding team of Book Bank Africa, a nonprofit that provides free books to underprivileged children. We organized drives and events, helping improve literacy in underserved communities.

I have not raised any funding

If I earned $150,000, I would give 10% to charity, and one that I hold dear to heart is the Book Bank Africa charity I have worked with in the past. The reason is that I strongly believe supporting literacy for underprivileged children is a powerful way of breaking poverty cycles and creating opportunities for them.

I would start with option (D). When customers demonstrate that they are willing to pay for a product or a service, it means there's a real problem that you are providing a solution for. It's also a way of validating your solution because people are willing to forgo their hard earned money for it.  

The next would be option (B). If there's a total addressable market, this shows that the potential customer base is growing, and this is an opportunity for the company to scale, grow, and acquire more users.  

I would then pick option (A). I believe that a founder needs to have a likeness to the idea and have passion fr it because there will be times when it's the passion that drives the company when all odds are against the company.¬†  

Lastly, I would pick option(C). Having a number of competitors in the market can be a good sign of market validation. It can be a positive sign. Fr example, there a 1001 fintech startups in the world, but what makes each one different is how they execute and sell their product.
