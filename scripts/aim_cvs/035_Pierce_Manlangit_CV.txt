Domain Expertise

I embody Bryan Johnson’s idea: “You can be ambitious as fuck and healthy—they’re not mutually exclusive.” For me, this means cultivating physical, social, financial, and creative health among others while working ambitiously. Not perfect, but always striving—and kind to myself in the process! :)

Laying down the assumptions that this is take home pay, and my cost of living comfortably is similar to what I currently spend, which is close to 20,000 USD/year (that includes investing and saving for financial health safety net),  I would donate the rest of excess money of 130,000 USD to Giving What We Can and funnel it equally to their Global Health and Wellbeing, Effective Animal Advocacy, and Risks and Resilience Funds. I believe and trust that they do rigorous and counterfactual analysis on where my money goes further in terms of impact. 

I would rank the four factors from most to least importance to evaluating potential of a startup idea during the program as: 1. A, 2. B, 3. D, 4. C. I give personal fit with idea as the highest because you need strong grit and perseverance to continue the work, being ambitious take a stab of believing the impossible to be possible. While I'm generally cause neutral, having a strong sense on alignment to the work really take the startup further along. Total addressable market would be my second important factor because it gives you the total scope of what's possible or what upper bound limits your working with while demonstrated customers willing to pay come third because this will help you understand a good product-market fit. The competition comes in last for me as there's always an ingenious way to enter the cracks where competitors fail to deliver and slowly take up space strategically to convert in more customers. In summary, I take alignment as priority, followed by the problem space & product-market fit, then competitor analysis in order of importance to pursue a startup idea during the 3-month program.
