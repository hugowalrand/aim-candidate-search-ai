Management, Startup Experience

I am proud of founding Quryltai.hu, a Kazakh-Hungarian association that fosters community and cultural exchange. It grew from a small idea into a nationally recognized platform.

The funding I raised was philanthropic, primarily through nonprofit grants and donor outreach. I led the application process, wrote proposals, and built relationships with supporters to secure funding for our mission-driven work.

If I were earning $150,000 USD per year at this point in my life, I would be honest in saying that I would not donate a large portion of it to charity right away. I am still in the early stages of my career and would prioritize establishing a stable foundation this includes securing housing, building a financial safety net, and making sure I can support myself and potentially my family. These are basic needs that I believe are important to meet before I can commit to more substantial giving.

That said, charitable giving is definitely something I think about seriously and want to integrate into my life in the long term. Even during this early period, I would still aim to donate a small portion perhaps 1-2% of my income specially to organizations that I believe are making a tangible, life-saving impact. I admire charities that operate with a high level of cost-effectiveness and transparency, especially those recommended by independent evaluators like GiveWell. For example, the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) is one organization I would consider donating to. They provide insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent malaria, and according to research, they are among the most cost-effective charities in the world in terms of lives saved per dollar spent.

I‚Äôm also particularly moved by organizations that support vulnerable children, such as those working to prevent malnutrition or provide healthcare to newborns in low-income countries. One area that deeply resonates with me is maternal and child health, particularly programs in sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia where infant mortality remains high. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) programs, which support premature or low-birthweight infants through skin-to-skin contact and other simple interventions, seem to be an extremely impactful and scalable solution.

I view charitable giving not as a one-time act but as a lifelong commitment. As my income and stability grow, so will my contributions. I admire the values behind initiatives like "Founders Pledge" or "Giving What We Can" and plan to explore a formal giving pledge once I reach a level of financial security that allows me to give more generously and consistently.

Of course, if I were to be selected for this program and accept the terms such as donating 50% of exit earnings above $1 million I would fully respect and commit to that. I see that obligation not as a restriction, but as a shared value: using personal success to generate meaningful change in the world. In fact, being part of a community that shares this ethic of giving would make me more intentional and disciplined about charitable giving even early on.

While I would start with modest donations now due to my personal financial circumstances, I'm committed to growing my charitable contributions over time. My goal is to align my career and values in a way that allows me to make the greatest impact both through my work and through effective giving.

Ranking:

(B) Total addressable market

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

(A) Personal fit with the idea

(C) Number of competitors in the market

When evaluating the potential of a startup idea, I believe the total addressable market (TAM) is the most important factor. No matter how passionate you are about an idea or how few competitors there are, if the market size is too small, the impact and scalability of the startup will be inherently limited. A large and growing TAM increases the likelihood that the business can scale, attract investment, and make a meaningful impact financially or socially. Startups exist to solve real problems for many people. If the potential reach is narrow from the beginning, then the ceiling is low, regardless of other variables.

The second most important factor is demonstrated customer willingness to pay. It‚Äôs one thing to identify a problem and a market. It‚Äôs another thing to verify that people are actually willing to spend money to solve that problem. Willingness to pay is an early validation of product-market fit. Too many startups fail because they assume demand without testing whether customers are motivated enough to pay for the solution. Even in high-impact or mission-driven fields, being financially sustainable is essential. Clear signals of willingness to pay (e.g. successful pilots, early sales, strong user interest) reduce uncertainty and improve decision-making about whether to pursue or pivot an idea.

Personal fit with the idea comes third. While it‚Äôs valuable to be excited about what you're building especially when working long hours and navigating uncertainty, I don't think this should outweigh objective indicators of potential. In my view, it's better to work on a high-potential idea that you are moderately aligned with than a personally meaningful idea that has low chance of success or impact. That said, I recognize the importance of motivation and commitment. So personal fit can make a difference once multiple ideas have cleared the ‚Äúimpact‚Äù and ‚Äúfeasibility‚Äù filters.

Finally, the number of competitors in the market is the least important factor. In fact, I believe a high number of competitors can be a sign of a healthy and profitable market. If no one else is solving a problem, that could signal a real opportunity or a lack of demand. The key is not whether others are operating in the same space, but whether you can offer something meaningfully better: more efficient, more accessible, more impactful. A crowded market doesn‚Äôt mean failure; it often means there‚Äôs a real need. The focus should be on differentiation and execution, not on being the only player.

In conclusion, a startup‚Äôs potential should first be assessed through objective market factors‚Äîhow many people it can serve and whether they are willing to pay. Personal fit and competition should be considered, but only after establishing the external viability of the idea. This approach helps ensure that startup efforts are not only personally fulfilling, but scalable, needed, and sustainable.
