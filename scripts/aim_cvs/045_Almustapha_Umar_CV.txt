Domain Expertise, Management

I am proud of achieving the fitness goal I set for myself a while back

I have helped to raise a funding of less than 500k$ for a feeding programme

I will donate nothing less than $50,000 USD to a charity organisation for the homeless. This is because where I live has a lot of homeless people and I believe if they have a roof over their heads they can be more productive and useful than the society

For me the rankings will be as follows   1. Demonstrated Customer Willingness to Pay  
2. Total Addressable Market   
3. Personal fit with Idea  
4. Number of Competitors in the Market   

My reason for this ranking is that a business needs to have paying customers which if not present will make massive TAM just noise. Also having a bad or unwanted product will make the best fit founder fail which finally brings us to competition.
