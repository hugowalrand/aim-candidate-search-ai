Domain Expertise, Management

This would be volunteering to speak in schools, mentor students, and guide graduates on building meaningful careers aligned with their passion, strengths and values. It‚Äôs deeply fulfilling to see some of these individuals go on to secure scholarships, land great jobs, or start impactful ventures.

I have raised over $100,000 grant funds for Ceneco Green Power and Solar4Health Africa which i both co-founded and actively leading.

If I made $150,000 USD in salary per year, I would donate 10% of that to Solar4Health Africa, a nonprofit organization that Ceneco Green Power, my founded clean energy company currently supports by contributing 10% of its profits. I would support this organization because I strongly believe that no community should be without safe water supply, and no healthcare center should be without reliable electricity, especially during emergencies when power can mean the difference between life and death.  

One of the Solar4Health Africa‚Äôs objectives to provide clean, uninterrupted power to health facilities across Africa, beginning with Nigeria to directly supports critical care delivery and aligns with my values of sustainable impact and equitable access to essential services.

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

(A) Personal fit with idea

(B) Total addressable market

(C) Number of competitors in the market

As a founder and entrepreneur, I believe the most critical factor in knowing if an idea is worth pursuing is demonstrated customer willingness to pay for a solution a startup is offering to solve the identified pain point(s). The demonstrated willingness to pay serves as the veritable signal of product-market fit and a strong indicator that the problem being solved is real and urgent..

Second is the personal fit with the idea. The founders are far more likely to¬† attract requisite human resources and necessary supports when he or she is not personally fit to complement the existing resources to aid execution.

The total addressable market is very crucial for scale, but less immediately useful without validation of demand or founder alignment. A huge market is meaningless if no one pays or if the team can not maximize it to build a sustainable business effectively.

Finally, number of competitors for me is the least important at the early stage of a startup. A crowded market can be a good signs of demand. But, differentiation often matters more than being first. Execution, focus, and unique insight most times win over startup novelty.
