I initiated and completed a pre-incubation programme to explore sustainable, community-based solutions to period poverty in Kenya. What began as a personal concern became a values-driven project to prototype a menstrual health platform combining social impact and climate-conscious design.

I have no experience with this.

I would donate 10‚Äì15% of my income annually, guided by effective altruism principles. A significant portion would go to GiveWell-recommended charities such as the Malaria Consortium for their proven, cost-effective impact on global health.

I would also support organisations focused on gender equity and health justice in the Global South, especially those addressing systemic barriers, such as period poverty. These are issues I‚Äôve engaged with professionally and personally, and they remain underfunded yet highly impactful.

To ensure my giving is as effective as possible, I would periodically review donation impact using evidence-based evaluation tools. My goal would be to align heart and reason, supporting causes that matter deeply to me while maximising measurable good.

B) Total Addressable Market ‚Äì¬†



I prioritise scale first because impact is fundamentally about reaching the maximum number of people effectively.¬†Without sufficient scale, even the most innovative solution remains limited in its potential for meaningful change.

D) Demonstrated Customer Willingness to pay

Validation is second because potential impact is only realised when people genuinely engage with a solution. If people are willing to pay for a product or donate, it's a strong signal that they value the solution and that it aligns with real needs.

A) Personal fit with the idea

¬†My personal connection to the problem creates unique leverage points within the ecosystem. Being "married to the problem" provides insider insights, authentic motivation, and the persistence required for breakthrough solutions. This personal fit often reveals high-leverage intervention points that outsiders might miss, maximising the effectiveness of our approach.

C) Number of competitors in the market



While important for strategic positioning, competition analysis comes last because our primary goal is impact maximisation, not market dominance. In effective altruist thought, "neglectedness" means how much good would be done by an additional person working on the problem.¬†In saturated markets, I prefer developing solutions that amplify existing competitors' impact rather than duplicating efforts, ensuring our contribution adds genuine value to the ecosystem.
