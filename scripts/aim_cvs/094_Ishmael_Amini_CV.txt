I would donate 10% to animal welfare organizations and child well fare orgazations. This is because animals and children expect care from us.

(A) Personal fit with idea: this is because a person can not start an idea which he/she don't know how to how to finish or handle.

(C) Number of competitors in the market: this point comes next in the sense that if competitors out number your capacity then your idea may shatter.

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay: this comes third in the sense that the idea which people are not interested can be a mere dream as they cannot pay.

(B) Total addressable market: this come last in the list because the first 3 are crucial in evaluating a startup.
