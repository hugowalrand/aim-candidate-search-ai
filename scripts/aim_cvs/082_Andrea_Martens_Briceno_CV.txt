Domain Expertise, Management, Startup Experience

I left a promising career against the wished of those around me who loved me and decided to go on a solo 2 month trip across Africa that turned into 6 years becoming the first Peruvian female long term solo traveller and encouraging other latin women to ditch societal norms and take risks.

I would donate 10% (15k). 

Enseña Perú (Peru), places talented professionals in underserved schools.  Peru ranks 74th in global education rankings, and the lack of quality education is one of the key barriers keeping people below the poverty line. I support them because improving education creates long-term, systemic change and brings more equal opportunities for future generations across Peru.

Planeta Océano (Peru), engages youth and communities in protecting marine biodiversity and sustainable fisheries.I support them because I believe that to reduce animal consumption, we must work with communities, not against them, especially those whose livelihoods depend on the ocean. By fostering a shift in behavior and relationship toward marine life from an early age, this organization lays the groundwork for more conscious, compassionate, and sustainable choices in the future.



Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (Kenya) Rescues and rehabilitates orphaned elephants and reintegrates them into the wild. Elephants are keystone species that have been killed for years due to lack of education in other parts of the world and lack of opportunities locally. Elephants changed my life and i would like to give back to them.

(B) the market is sometimes not ready for a big idea, so it doesnt need to already be 100% totally addressable, but there needs to be a roadmap of how to make it work. it doesnt help to give kids in the Andes ipads if they dont have electricity at home.

(D) someone needs to pay for the product in order to make this work long term. However, customers might not be willing to pay yet for a novelty idea because they are skeptic or dont understand it. It is important to find alternative sources of revenue, like advertisements, to ensure someone pays while people get into the new idea.  

(A) i could get behind almost any idea that will do good for people, nature or animals. I think we are driven by the impact even when the core idea is not our main interest.

(C) number of competitors doesnt say much, are they good competitors? If we are thinking of starting something similar its because we see a gap in the markets, then we must have a better product to offer which means the number of competitors wouldnt matter as long as our product is better.
