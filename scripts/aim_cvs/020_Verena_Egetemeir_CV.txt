My contributions would go to The Ocean Cleanup, for its innovative and scalable technology removing plastic from rivers and oceans worldwide, and to Ingressive for Good, which empowers African youth with digital skills to build sustainable futures. I would support these organizations because they combine technology, innovation, and measurable global impact—one protecting nature, the other investing in human potential.
