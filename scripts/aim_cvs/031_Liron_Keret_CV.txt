Startup Experience

I'm proud of independently planning and completing a solo 3 months long trip across Southeast Asia. Managing logistics, budgeting, and real-time problem-solving enhanced my adaptability, resilience, and decision-making skills that continue to support me in professional environments.

N/A

I'd donate 5%-10% to charity, primarily to women-focused organizations or programs that support personal and professional growth, especially those where participation fees directly fund charitable initiatives.

The organizations I would donate are Michal Sela forum, Give and tech and Woman2Woman.



These charities represent a mix of causes I deeply care about: women's safety, empowerment, tech accessibility, and personal growth. I'm especially drawn to the diversity in their approaches: providing shelter and emotional support, to promoting innovation and self-defense through technology, to creating learning platforms where the act of gaining knowledge also contributes to a greater good.



I would rank (A) Personal fit with the idea as the most important. Having previous knowledge, live experience, or a strong personal drive increases the chances of staying motivated through the ups and downs of building something new. That alignment gives the idea real staying power.



Next, I'd prioritize (C) Number of competitors in the market. I'm drawn to less crowded spaces where needs have not yet been fully addressed. I want to bring something truly original to life and solve underserved problems.

In third place, I'd put (D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay, because while validation is important, I believe that when the cause truly matters, a sustainable business model will emerge through iteration and user focus.

Lastly, I'd rank (B) Total addressable market. While a large market might look attractive on paper, I believe that targeting a massive audience too early can distract from solving specific, meaningful problems. Impact often starts small, and depth can be more valuable than scale.

I used chatgpt to correct my grammar.
