A very cute dog was in a shelter for nearly two years before we fostered her. I kept the shelter updated with photos and stories, which helped to find her a new forever family within two weeks!

Commercial sponsorship for a Women in Tech + Allies university society. I created packages and negotiated with the companies.

I would donate around 10%.¬†

Firstly, I would donate to local animal shelters in Slovakia. They work only from donations and, unfortunately, oftentimes need to stretch out their budget. Even a relatively small donation (compared to the salary) would help to keep them financially safe for a long time.

Secondly, I would donate to a cancer charity called Maggie's. They are offering guidance to cancer patients and people close to them, without the need to book an appointment or paying any fees. They create an amazing atmosphere for the visitors, and the centers are filled with calmness and patience.¬†

I understand that these charities have reach only to a limited amount of people (and animals) but the lives of those that do use the services are significantly better because of them.

CBAD

1. C - Not only the number of competitors, but also the reason why there is so many/little. If there are no competitors, does it mean that they explored the idea and had significant evidence against continuing? Or is it because the idea is novel and we would be the first ones to try? On the other hand, if there are too many competitors, our idea would not reach the full potential even if it was successful. We would not start in a new market, but only get a slice of it and hence, decrease the potential impact.

2. B - It is important to understand who we would be targeting with this idea. If the market is smaller, I would be curious about the potential impact for an individual that our idea would have. When measuring it against other ideas, we could learn that this idea would have a huge impact for a smaller market compared to a small impact for a huge market which is arguably better.

3. A - I have some personal preferences for the idea, for example, to develop a digital health product. However, I am open to other ideas if they have a potential for a great impact. There are ideas that I would definitely not want to be a part of, for example, AI for defense drones. I expect to meet like-minded people during the program and hence, I expect to not explore such ideas during this program.

4. D - It depends on what type of product we are talking about. We can design a product where the customer does not need to pay anything directly and we can find other ways of maintaining it, where this part of evaluation is of lower priority. Of course, if we are thinking about a product which we market towards for-profit companies, we should evaluate whether they are willing to compensate us appropriately.
