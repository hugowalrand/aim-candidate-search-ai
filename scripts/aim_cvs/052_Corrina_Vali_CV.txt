Domain Expertise, Management

I am happy that I have deep and meaningful relationships with all my grandparents, I speak to them every week.

I led the round and raised $120k from angel investors. I've also successfully gotten a overdraft loan facility from a traditional bank to cover working capital needs.

I would donate 30% of my $150,000 salary—$45,000—across three buckets, each addressing a different layer of impact:

50% to GiveWell’s Global Health and Development Fund  
    These donations go to the most cost-effective, rigorously vetted interventions—things like malaria bed nets, vitamin A supplementation, and deworming. I value the transparency, evidence base, and moral clarity of saving and improving lives in the most direct way.

30% to institutions focused on evidence-based policymaking and global cooperation  
    Think tanks and orgs like the Center for Global Development or the Future of Humanity Institute work on improving international aid policy, forecasting, and smarter governance—less “measurable” than direct interventions but critical for long-term global systems change.

20% to public sector accountability organizations  
    These might include groups like the Accountability Lab, or smaller local watchdogs that work in the Global South to improve transparency, reduce corruption, and build trust in democratic institutions. This work is underfunded and hard to evaluate, but deeply important—especially in fragile states.

I like balancing immediate impact (health), structural reform (policy), and political capacity (accountability)—because each is necessary, and they often don’t talk to each other.

1. Total Addressable Market (TAM): I’d rank this first because even a brilliant execution in a small or stagnant market is limiting, while a large and growing TAM allows a startup to pivot, expand, and attract funding and talent down the line. The opportunity has to be big enough to matter, and it should have the headroom to scale over time.  

2. Personal Fit with Idea:  
Personal fit determines staying power. If you are intrinsically motivated and have a credible edge—domain knowledge, empathy for the customer, or a unique insight—you’ll persist through inevitable setbacks. It also tends to improve judgment: you can see nuances others miss.  

3. Demonstrated Customer Willingness to Pay: Once you know the market is large and you have the right founder fit, validating that customers will actually pay is critical. I rank it below TAM and personal fit because in many early-stage explorations, willingness-to-pay can be discovered and iterated on, but the market and the founder’s motivation are harder to change.  

4. Number of Competitors: I’d rank this last. The presence of competitors can be a positive sign that the problem is worth solving. Unless competitors are truly solving the problem well, they do not meaningfully block an opportunity. The nuances of differentiation and execution matter much more than whether competitors simply exist.
