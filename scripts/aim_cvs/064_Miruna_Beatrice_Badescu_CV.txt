Frontend Development, DevOps, LLM/AI

It's probably not the biggest achievement in the traditional sense, but it's what really strikes a chord when thinking about this past year - I am proud of having been consistent and diligent with the care I put into my own life and the lives of the people I care most about.

Part of what I am working towards is a stable enough career where I can open my own charities hopefully aimed towards people who might feel stuck in their current circumstance, whether that be a mental health issue, domestic violence, financial abuse etc.

My values are very closely aligned with the wellbeing of people and I believe giving them access systematically to information about that their situation, whatever kind of crisis they might be dealing with, is fundamental to them taking steps towards wanting to seek help.¬†

Mind UK is an organization that I really look up to specifically for these reasons. Had I had that salary I would look into funding not only outreach programs for them, but also funding research in precision psychiatry for people with debilitating mental health problems. I am unsure how much this would cost, but I would assume a sizeable amount of my salary, likely a third or more.

1. A - I believe everyone's inclinations (whether natural or nurtured) drive them towards specific ideas. Finding what drives someone is in my eyes the reason a start up should be started to begin with, a person deciding something they want to see in the world is not there, and doing their best to add it to the world.

2. C - Not only is considering this a substantial part of considering the market you are looking to launch in, I think it also speaks of a certain kind of problem solving mentality i.e. finding out where your competitors are falling short, looking specifically to impact that, and thus minimizing the number of competitors you are working against to begin with.

3. B - Sales wise, considering how many your product could reach is important. Impact wise, it is important to know the people you wish your product or service will have an effect on, so it can be tailored to them, so you can make sure your product does in fact reach the market you are looking to address.

4. D - I think this is quite nuanced, because different services and products will be priced differently, and that impacts willingness to pay. Finding your market, and making sure you are making something they will want to pay for, makes this factor the least important in my eyes.
