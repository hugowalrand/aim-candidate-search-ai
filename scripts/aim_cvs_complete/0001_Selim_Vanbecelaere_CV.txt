 Management 
 Jumping head-first into improv theatre without any prior acting experience in 2018. It showed me the power of saying "yes and", as well as the value of creating something from nothing with others. I've loved sharing the stage with my co-founders of¬†'Falafel Waffle', an international¬†improv troupe.

On the other side of the table as impact investor in funding rounds of multiple early-stage ventures. I have also crowdfunded personally for my volunteering project in Peru.

How much I donate would depend on my spendable income, so also on where it is generated. Assuming that after taxes and all living expenses I retain $70k of spendable income, I would donate in the range of 20% of spendable income which I foresee increasing with age. I would aim to donate to the most cost-effective organizations tackling the most urgent problems with highest impact. Evaluating the impact across non-profits is a complicated issue i.a. due to the lack of standardized impact measurement and management frameworks (IMM). Hence, I would not try to reinvent the wheel and allocate 80% of my donation budget to an evaluator such as the GiveWell Top Charities Fund that evaluate where a dollar goes furthest in areas typically neglected. This in order to maximize the additionality of my donations across topics globally - ranging from poverty, health and animal welfare to more niche problems - while getting started and avoiding to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I would equally weight the 20% of my donation budget to put more emphasis on issues I care about more deeply, such as poverty alleviation (GiveDirectly), education and combatting polarisation. These weightings are quite arbitrary but I would combine a mix of ratio and emotion - striving for highest impact while aligning it with my values - and review the approach on an annual basis while learning from others.

Personal fit (founder/problem fit)
Demonstrated customer willingness to pay
Total addressable market
Number of competitors in the market

From my experience the 3 most important things about launching a startup are team, team and team. Hence, before validating problem-solution fit, it is crucial that the founder is in love with solving the problem (and not with their own solution, as this will most likely change in time). The founders need to have an edge and complementary expertise specific to the problem they're tackling.¬†¬†  

Secondly, ideally a startup idea could solve a burning, urgent problem ("my hair is on fire" type vs. incremental improvements). Not all important societal problems have stakeholders who are sufficiently willing to pay for solving them. For those, if solvable at all, the for-profit route is likely inadequate (e.g. tackling opioid addiction in US). So, any signs of sufficient potential for building a sustainable business in the long-term are very important. It can be very tricky to test this as I believe the only real way of gauging willingness to pay is actually putting the product in front of people and asking money. I think that prioritizing traction and velocity is the best way to evaluate a startup idea. In the early stages, such traction does not always have to be revenue, but it¬†should be a proxy for the value creation and help indicate the long-term potential for building a profitable business (e.g. customer engagement metrics).  

Although total relevant market size (TAM/SAM/SOM) is important, I believe it can often not reliably be estimated in the early stages. Often times there will be many pivots on the road to profitability, so it is better to start solving a burning problem in a niche market to reach critical mass before expanding to larger markets. Pre-mature growth, before a business model is truly validated and sustainable, is a killer of many startups. Sometimes there are adjacent markets that are not initially clear at the idea-stage. Hence, count-yourself-rich exercises such as "if we capture only 0,5% of the global compostable straws market" at the idea stage are not relevant.  

Finally, the main killer of startups is still suicide instead of death by competitors. Founders who claim they have no competition have often either 1) not done their research, or 2) are solving a problem for which there is no market. Instead, as mentioned in my first point, the edge or 'secret sauce' of the founders and their idea/solution should be clear and credible.¬†
