 Management 
 I climbed mount Kilimanjaro to the highest peak as part of the JCI Youth Summit at the Summit in 2020. As part of this I raised money for the UN's foundation Nothing but Nets, a global grassroots campaign that raises awareness, funds and voices to fight malaria.

I would donate 9% to Giving What We Can to help the most effective charities. Furthermore, I would donate 1% to charities that I have a good feeling towards and am supporting already (in Dutch): Milieudefensie, Liliane Fonds, Fight Cancer, Hospitaalbroeders, Natuurmonumenten, WNF, Wilde Ganzen, Nacht van de vluchteling, Alpe d'HuZes

B, D, C, A

I think it is very important that there is a large market for the idea or many people to be helped. Furthermore, it is important that customers are willing to pay for the product, so that the start-up can scale and reach more people and prove a sustainable business. Although it might also be possible that people are willing to support (donate) the start-up if people can effectively be helped. I consider the number of competitors in the market as a less important factor, because the idea can be very different and much better than products already on the market. Personally I really want to have a good personal fit with an idea for a startup to continue working on it myself, but if we're researching and brainstorming ideas, this would be the least important, since there might be other people that are really attracted to the idea and after learning more, I might even become more interested myself.
