 I was a practice player for the University of Michigan Women's Basketabll team. This is sentimental to me because It was my dream to step on a D1 basketball court. I might not be the main character on the court but I am still grateful to have the opportunity to help the girls.

N/A

I would donate 5% of my income to Feed my starving children (FMSC). I did not come from money, so whenever I do charity it is usually my actions other than money. From my perspective, FMSC means more to me than donating money because I never know what the organization are doing with the money. One of my goals is to help kids who are in developing countries because they deserve a change to shine. I would rather focus on building my wealth and then use my wealth to do charity directly supervised by myself to make sure all the money are going to the people who are in need.

I would rank A, D, C, B.  
I ranked (A) Personal fit with idea first because from my personal experience of working for multiple startups, nothing can beat passion. They are going to be ups and downs but mostly downs and to me passion is what keeps my head up and keep grinding.¬†  
Ranked (D) Demonstrate customer willingness to pay because I understand that even if it is a great idea, using the latest tech whatsoever, if no one wants them, they don't mean nothing. I am a firm believer that always listen to your customers because at the end of the day they are the one who would use your products. Founders are usually easily blinded by their passion for their ideas but not looking at the reality and listen to the customers' needs.  
I ranked (C) and (B) last because having competitors is completely normal and your just have to find your niche and figure out why people would use your products other than others. Serviceable Obtainable Market is what matters the most and even if it is only a small percent of the market if you can capture all of them it is still worth to pursue.
