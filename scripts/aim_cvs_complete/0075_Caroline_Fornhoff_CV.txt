 Climbed mount Kilimanjaro (and reached summit!) 

Gave birth to two girls (4 (and a half, seems to be very important) and almost 2). 

Succesfully managed and built a hotel in Zanzibar. 

I have not raised funding yet.

Depending on what my partner would earn. We would need 100.000 USD per year for our personal goals (such as schooling, moving abroad,...) The 50.000 USD I would rather spend for developing or supporting other sustainable businesses rather than donating the money. That would be my answer for now but that might change when I get to know more about certain organizations.

A (I would need a fit with the idea to keep being driven and motivated)

D (I'd like to feel some certainty that what I'm doing would be able to be succesful).

B 

C (when doing something good, it's only great to know there are other parties (trying to) do the same.
