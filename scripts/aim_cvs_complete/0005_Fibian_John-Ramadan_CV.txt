 Domain Expertise, Management 
 I won a writing competition in the nature category where I wrote about " The Invisible Nature" which was in contrast with physical visual nature, which might be why I won I guess. This has encouraged me to take my writing seriously. I'm currently working on completing a four series Novel.

Through an Angel investors, I researched online, made contact, wrote concept notes, communicated back and forth, and provided all documents needed

If I made $150,000 USD a year, I will donate 10% annually to "Girls not bride" which is $15,000. I would donate to them because I was privileged to go to school and build a career in spite of my background and community. Coming from Middle belt Nigeria, I understand the importance of educating young girls and not encouraging them to get married at an early age like most girls do in my state.

(A) Personal Fit with idea: A founder with a personal fit will make any idea work. He or she will be willing with work, put in the hours and make the relevant sacrifices needed to make the start- up. (D) Demonstrated customer's willingness to pay: A customers willingness to pay practically validates the start-up idea. This shows the potential market fit, making the go-to-market strategy more effective. with high potential revenue generation and traction. (B)Total addressable Market: is a very important indicator of scalability potential of the start- up product which is very attractive to investors and VC. It is also an early start-up success indicator. Lastly, (C) Number of competitors in the Market: I ranked this last because, I believe that a startup can work in spite of a crowed market or high level of competition. It all comes down to how well a start-up can differentiate its offerings and market positioning. Which is why in my opinion Zoom was able to take over the market with strong compositors like skype and cisco weebex.
