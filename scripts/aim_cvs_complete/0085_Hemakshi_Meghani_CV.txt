 Domain Expertise, Management 
 I’m proud of my inner work journey, which has deepened my ability to hold space for others. I’ve built communities of secular spirituality and mentorship networks for marginalized students, fostering belonging and shared growth beyond traditional institutions.

I have raised 1.5 mn USD for my non profit through philantoropis, High net work individuals, incubators, crowdfunding, competitions, fellowships

Even when I was earning 4000 USD/year, I donated 15% of my income. As my salary increased, I donate atleast 20-25% of my salary to non profits ( I have also only worked in non profits most of my career) . 

My primary causes include- education for children in rural areas, life skills and vocational skills for girls from economically weaker sections and gift economy based vipassana ( meditation centres). I usually pick smaller charities located in difficult geographies that dont get much attention like - Shiksharth ( in tribal education), Udayan Care ( for adolescent girls) and Vipassana centres across India. 

My ranking would be A, B, D, C

A) As an entrepreneur, I think personal fit is most important so as to not burn out, really bring one's best self to the innovation itself and building an organization. Profits or success alone can not be the driving force in the long run, for the spirit of the person

B) I think great products can expand the addressable market, but its important to have a sense of it and for it to be a critical size, when starting. Something too niche is very difficult to scale  ( but my experience here is limited so I could change my mind depending on the idea) 

D) Willingness to pay is really important, but I am not sure if all ideas, especially innovate ones have past evidence to rely on. There can be other indicators of paying for complementary or similar items which can be used when making business decisions. First movers have to usually create a demand ( Apple, tesla, Airbnb etc) 

C) if the idea is new and truly innovative, we may not have competitors yet. Yes there could be lessons to learn about barriers to entry in the market, but I would not let the number of competitors deter or motivate me if I truly believe in the start up. Yes if its too crowded, I would refine my product to serve an unserved need or want.
