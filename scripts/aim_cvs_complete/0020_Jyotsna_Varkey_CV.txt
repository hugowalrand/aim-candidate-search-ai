 Management, Startup Experience 
 I run a non-profit vocational center with my dad in our village in Kerala, India. Over the years, 700+ women have received computer and accounting skills enabling them to find employment in the community. We recently partnered with the government through Keltron boosting our hiring rates by 30%.

I currently run a bootstrapped company. We have reinvested money from the family business for starting capital.

Each year I earmark ten percent of my gross salary (which is about $15 000 on a $150 000 income) for education nonprofits that have strong evidence of impact in India, where Figora also works. I split the money between two organizations whose programs cover complementary stages of the learning journey.

Pratham Education Foundation receives sixty percent of the pot (roughly $9 000). Pratham is India‚Äôs best-known literacy charity and, in 2023-24, its programs (run directly and through state-government partnerships) reached nearly nine million children. Their ‚ÄúTeaching at the Right Level‚Äù model has repeatedly lifted basic reading and arithmetic skills for primary-school learners at very low cost. I appreciate Pratham‚Äôs large data sets (the annual ASER survey) and audited reports, which let donors see exactly what their money accomplishes.

The remaining forty percent (around $6 000) goes to Rocket Learning. This younger nonprofit delivers play-based early-childhood lessons to parents and Anganwadi teachers via WhatsApp, already engaging about 3.5 million children across ten Indian states. A recent partnership with LGT Venture Philanthropy backs an expansion plan to serve 12 million children a year by 2028. Rocket Learning‚Äôs mobile-first approach keeps costs below two dollars per child per year and meshes well with my own belief that simple technology can close learning-equity gaps at scale.

I donate monthly so the cash flow supports each organization‚Äôs operating cycle, and I stay involved by reviewing their quarterly progress notes. Focusing my giving on a small, high-accountability set of partners makes it easy to track results and keeps my philanthropic effort aligned with my broader aim: ensuring more children master the basics early and can progress confidently through school‚Äîwhether or not they ever use Figora‚Äôs programs.

Ranking from most important to least important, the order would be as follows:¬†

1. Demonstrated willingness to pay (D).

Actual dollars on the table are the strongest signal that the problem is painful enough and the solution valuable enough. Even early, a few paid pilots or LOIs reduce the riskiest assumption which is "will anyone really buy?" It gives you concrete feedback loops for product-market fit. Ideas die far more often from lack of paying demand than from any of the other factors.

  

2. Personal fit (A).

Once you‚Äôve proven someone will pay, the next limiter is whether you are the right person to push the rock uphill for years. Founder-market fit blends motivation, credibility, network, and unique insight. A mediocre idea in the hands of an aligned founder often outperforms a brilliant idea run by someone who‚Äôs half-hearted or lacks relevant strengths and motivations.

  

3. Total addressable market (B).

TAM matters for long-term upside and for attracting later investors, but in the program‚Äôs time frame it‚Äôs a directional check rather than a go/no-go gate. Many great companies started in apparently small or mismeasured markets that later expanded (e.g., Airbnb, Shopify). A clear early beachhead plus willingness-to-pay can justify starting even if the initially obvious TAM looks modest.

  

4. Number of competitors (C).

Competition, in itself, is the least predictive. A crowded field can mean demand is real; a ‚Äúblue ocean‚Äù can mean no one actually cares. What matters is your ability to differentiate through focus, business model, or execution speed, rather than the raw count of players. Assessing differentiation loops back into factors A and D more than into C.

  

In short: first de-risk payment, then confirm founder-idea fit, ensure the market can grow big enough, and only then worry about how many others are circling the same opportunity.
