 My sister and I have different passports, mine Dutch-Nigerian, hers only Nigerian. Our diverging opportunities shaped my perspective on inequality. After five years, I pushed my father to apply for her UK resident permit. I refuse to let her be limited by nationality and negligence induced poverty.

The three above are cost effective, high impact and solve the worlds most pressing issues  

(A)   
The most important aspect of building a startup is founder fit. A team may have a great idea, but without the right background, conviction, or understanding of the customer, they will fail. Success comes from belief in the product and the ability to listen, learn, and iterate based on customer feedback.

(D)   
If customers are paying, or showing real commitment, the idea is already creating value. This is the clearest signal that a startup is on the right track. It also forces founders to move beyond ideas and build something that solves real problems.

(B)   
The market does not have to be massive at the start, but it must be large enough to sustain another entrant. Growth in the market is necessary and desirable so that startups can benefit from secular growth. Beginning in a small niche and scaling once value has been proven is a tried and tested method for success. 

(C)  
Competition is not an independent metric of startup quality but instead a consideration in strategy. Many competitors indicate a proven market, which in turn should raise questions of differentiation. Few competitors raise the questions of whether structural reasons exist that prevent the product from being built.
