 Over the past five years, I‚Äôve shifted to a plant-based diet, despite having very mixed feelings about most vegetables. Soylent has been a big help.

Not applicable

I would donate about $30k to charity. This is based on what I can comfortably live on and my desire to save for potential expenses in the future.  

What I can comfortably live on: I currently earn a gross income of $82,000, with no benefits, at the nonprofit I co-founded. Besides typical living expenses, I need to cover student loans ($9,000 per year) and health insurance (also $9,000 per year). At this salary, I am breaking even, not increasing or decreasing my wealth.  

Saving for potential expenses in the future: I don't have kids currently but want to be prepared financially in case I one day do. Keeping about $110,000 for myself (including the taxes I‚Äôd need to pay on it), would allow me to cover my current living expenses and save for future potential expenses. With the remaining $40,000, about $10,000 would go to taxes. (Even with the charitable deduction, I would need to pay some FICA taxes in the US, and the deduction is capped.)  

Donating $30,000 would allow me to maintain my current lifestyle and be prepared for a larger household. It also would allow me to meet the pledge to I made to Giving What We Can to donate 10% of my income.  

I would donate 90% ($27,000) of the funding to Family Empowerment Media (FEM). FEM is a charity that I co-founded through the Charity Entrepreneurship Incubation Program. It has the potential to be highly cost-effective and I am confident in the management team (even after I step down). I am also the President of the Board so I will be aware of any issues that may arise. I expect that FEM will continue to have room for more funding, at least for the next year.  

I would give the remaining 10% ($3,000) to a Charity Entrepreneurship incubated charity working on animal welfare. My default option would be the Fish Welfare Initiative (FWI), as I know their leadership team best. However, I would consider other options if FWI did not have room for more funding.  

I would split my giving 90-10, rather than giving entirely to FEM for three main reasons. First, I draw satisfaction from considering the impact that I am personally having. By diversifying where I give, I increase the odds that my money is having at least some positive impact. Second, while being associated with FEM gives me greater insight into its potential for impact, it also increases the likelihood that my giving decision is biased. I think it is important to contribute to an organization where I have no personal interest. Third, I would like to support animal welfare work for impact diversification reasons. I think the importance of animal welfare work is at least as strong as the importance of global health work, though cost-effective giving opportunities may be limited in the former.

Note: In answering this question, I have assumed there is no value in re-investing the money back into the business.

It's hard to take factors (B), (C), and (D) in isolation. For example, take total addressable market. If it is high, the number of competitors in the market is low, and demonstrated customer willingness to pay is high, then the startup idea would look very promising (although it would beg the question, 'why aren't there more competitors in the market?‚Äô). On the other hand, if total addressable market is high, but the number of competitors in the market is high, and demonstrated willingness to pay is low, then the startup idea would look unpromising.¬†  

That said, if I had to rank those three factors, I would rank them in order of priority: first -¬† total addressable market, second - demonstrated customer willingness to pay, and third ‚Äì number of competitors in the market.

I would put total addressable market first for two reasons. First, a small total addressable market indicates that how much a startup can grow is limited, at least in the short term. For example, because the total addressable market for smartwatches in Benin is small, even if we have the top-selling smartwatch, we will not have outsized profits. Second, a large total addressable market can indicate that there is room for healthy profits even with a small share of the market.

Demonstrated customer willingness to pay is important at the idea stage and grows more important with business maturity. If customers won‚Äôt pay for a product or service, the business has no chance. Granted, new products or services require some customer awareness. However, businesses with innovative products or services can look to similar products or services as proxies for willingness to pay, and conduct their own tests to assess willingness to pay.¬†The threshold of what counts as ‚Äúdemonstration‚Äù should increase with business maturity.

While number of competitors in the market is important, what‚Äôs more important is number of competitors offering the a comparable product or service of the new startup. If the startup is in a crowded field but has found a market niche, the question becomes, ‚Äòcan the existing competitors in the market pivot and beat us once they see us gain some share?‚Äô Often there are first mover advantages ‚Äì or existing companies would prefer to acquire the upstart rather than compete with it.

I would rank personal fit with the idea last. For me, if I think there is a business idea that can generate a return that beats the risk adjusted cost of capital, I will be motivated to work on it. That said, I do need to feel that I have the skills and characteristics to advance the startup. And I need to feel that the startup is ‚Äì at the least ‚Äì not unethical (preferably it would serve as social good, but that's not essential). If those two conditions are met, I will be motivated by the big picture goal of earning to give and the day-to-day challenges of starting and running a business.
