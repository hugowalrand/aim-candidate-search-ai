 Domain Expertise 
 I've recently reconnected with painting after some time not feeling very expressive. I have found lots of joy through mini paintings which can be done in the moment and on the go, starting self-portraits, and have set a goal to take my art further to teach, raise awareness and donations.

I had raised funds for a commercial entity linked to my university alumni for research funding, so not technically commercial but I cold called alumni asking for one off and monthly donations.

Based on the average living costs within my means, I would donate $7500 to charity per year. I would donate to World Central Kitchen, and Health Poverty Action. I love the founding story for World Central Kitchen, and it delivers a really core need at the right time, right place. I recently connected with Health Poverty Action in a service station near Birmingham, and found out for every ¬£1, 96p goes towards their programmes. I can see the impact and they prefer sustainable solutions, so I think these two charities is where i'd start with that kind of money!

(C) likely will come first, given that low saturation helps infiltrate a solution with maximum impact and lowest resources. I would say (A) then comes next, understanding more and more of the 'why?' being the problem to make it my 'why' would keep me going. (B) is the mapping the risk and reward to entry, understanding who and what would be needed to tackle the core needs. I think at this stage if things are looking green, (D) will be a case of guiding action with simple truths, and bringing the customers along the journey.
