 While I was at Princeton I founded a student run sustainable investment fund. Now, the fund is one of the leading student groups on campus and a vehicle for teaching students about the energy transition.

At this stage in my career, I would donate perhaps $5,000 out of $150,000. This is not much, and over the course of my life my plan is to donate most of the money I make, but if I were working a job now, it would be to save money to fund a venture of my own. I believe that at the moment for the most part investing money in my own ventures will greatly out perform the market and ultimately lead to greater benefit down the road.¬†  

Considering the stage I am at, I also have not yet given much thought as to where I would donate this money. That being said based on the small amount of research I did prompted by this question, if required to provide an answer on the spot I would start out just by donating to the charities, now considered to have the most direct impact per dollar spent, such as AMF.¬†  

Beyond, AMF, especially if I had a lot of money to donate I would look into organizations that attempt more strategic bets such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. My dad has spent the last decade working on reforming governance models in local governments to be more transparent, and have federal funding distributed at a more results based basis, at the world bank. I don't think his work is in much need of funding but I would definitely talk to him about where money could be best spent.¬†  


I would rank these A, D, B, C.¬†  

A - At the end of the day I think it is founders, and their interests, and their passion, and their willingness to overcome barriers that results in great companies. If someone is doing something that is not a good fit for them this start up is doomed to failure (of course I think many founders find ideas that are not necessarily their passion, but believe in it enough to eventually make it their passion, still they must have this belief and have a general direction aligned with the idea that they believe strongly enough for whatever reason, or else they will quit).¬†  

D - I think this is the second most important thing as paying customers can be quite valuable to startups. Customers give a startup a reality feedback mechanism, motivation to team members and a revenue stream to fund future development.¬†  

B - Considering that a founder is very likely to discover more about an idea once they have started working on it, and may need to pivot, as long as the TAM is big enough, they are more likely to find success.¬†  

C- This is important but a lot of the most worthwhile things to do end up having a lot of people trying to do them. I think that it matters more that you take a differentiated approach to what you are building, that you have high conviction in this approach.
