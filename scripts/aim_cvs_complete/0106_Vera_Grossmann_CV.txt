 Management, Startup Experience 
 I founded the first German self-help group for families of children with regulatory disorders, sharing the knowledge and experience I gained through my own journey with my son to support other parents.

Ever since I started my professional career, I have been donating about $500 USD per year to UNICEF. Neither the donation amount nor the charity has changed over the years - mainly because my husband and I have been saving for old age, assuming that we cannot rely on anyone else.¬†

If my salary were to rise to $150,000 USD per year, I would take it as an opportunity to break that routine - especially now that our kids have grown out of their baby phase and my income is likely going to remain stable in the future. I would adopt a progressive donation model, starting with 10% of that income and continuosly adjusting the ratio and amount in line with salary increases.¬†

Investing in the health, education, and social well-being of the next generation, as I do with UNICEF, still feels like a sound decision. I would also continue to support regions that are historically and/or geographically disadvantaged. My 'donation vision' is to give every individual the same starting opportunities, regardless of birthplace, family status, or financial and academic background. I line with that, I would expand my giving to include a microcredit organization such as the Grameen Foundation, as well as GiveDirectly, which is working to make unconditional basic income a reality.¬†  

Professionally, my background is in sustainable mobility - with a particular focus on cycling - and in (digital) community building. I deeply believe in both causes and intend to invest not only money but also time to help these areas grow internationally.

In the cycling sector, there are global initiatives such as World Bicycle Relief and local initiatives like Qhubeka in South Africa. For my donations, I would likely favor the international charity to maximise global impact.

Finally, I believe that building and nurturing the right relationships can make all the difference in life. Having worked for the socially driven business InterNations, I have seen first-hand the value of strong communities. I am also a big fan of German start-up Volunteer Vision. Both organizations have struggled to grow and suffered losses during the pandemic. I'd love to use my business acumen and financial means to support one or both as a business angel.¬†

(A) Personal fit with idea¬†

(C) Number of competitors in the market¬†  

(B) Total addressable market¬†

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay



  

My first spontaneous reaction was to think that all factors are equally important - but on second thought I believe there is a clear hierarchy.¬†  

When I think about start-up founders I consider truly successful, they all have one thing in common: they have been personally confronted with the very needs they are trying to fulfill as founders. This gives them first-hand knowledge of their products or services and a deep understanding of their customers. Paired with genuine passion for their idea, this is an unbeatable combination.¬†

  

I place competitor numbers second because developing a new market typically requires far lower investments than entering an already saturated one - something I've seen first-hand with my previous employer, Company Bike. Start-ups that can get off the ground with limited initial investment have a much higher chance of success, especially outside the US market. InterNations is a great example: as a digital community supported by volunteering members, all it needed to launch a global business was a website.¬†

  

Next comes the addressable market. The smaller and more specific a target group, the harder it is to scale a product or service. Market saturation arrives quickly and often requires costly and complex changes to the company's offering to find new revenue streams - whether by improving the cost ratio per customer or by expanding into broader markets. Small target groups can be particularly challenging from a marketing perspective as they are usually harder and more expensive to reach due to scattering losses on general marketing channels.

  

Finally, I rank demonstrated customer willingness to pay as the least decisive factor when evaluating a business opportunity. In many industries, demand is rarely innate - it's mostly created by brand and marketing teams. Think of AirUp: who knew we all needed a drinking bottle that makes plain water smell like lemonade?¬†
