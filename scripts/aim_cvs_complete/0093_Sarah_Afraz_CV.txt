 Domain Expertise, Management 
 I was selected as one of three student speakers for Yale SOM‚Äôs combined commencement ceremony for the graduating classes of 2020 and 2021(800+ students) Being peer-elected was not just an honor but a way to give voice to the cohort's collective resilience and journey reshaped by the pandemic.

Archetype is a boutique consulting and venture fund. I was one of four engagement managers through whom all venture and consulting work was run. I led efforts to grow our consulting revenue which was a key income stream for the fund, and supported the leadership team in preparing materials to raise our second fund. I wasn‚Äôt the primary fundraiser, but was embedded in both tracks.

I would allocate 10-12% of my salary to charity; and depending on the stage of my career/savings aim to increase it to 25% in the next decade. Of the current $15-18K USD, I would give:¬†

35% to community-based, local giving (India)-  I think place-based philanthropy is critical in a person‚Äôs giving portfolio, it has helped me be an informed and active member of the community. I specifically give to areas where the market cannot reach and the state doesn‚Äôt prioritize, ie rights, voice and diginity. Organizations that defend dignity (Jan Sahas), amplify voice (Khabar Lahariya, The Caravan, Aagaz Theatre Group), and protect rights and accountability (Haqdarshak, Association of Democratic Reform, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan) all operate in spaces with minimal philanthropic cover but deep structural relevance.

40% to ‚ÄòAll Grants Fund‚Äô at GiveWell - I think of GiveWell ‚Äò All Grants Fund‚Äô as the mutual fund of philanthropy,¬† it is well diversified, rigorously vetted, evidence-based, and optimises for cost-effectiveness. They also charge 0% overhead, so all the money goes directly to the nonprofits. Since I have limited time and exposure, this helps cater to my blind spots in giving.¬†

10% to Responsible AI & AI Governance - I‚Äôd back organizations that are building global guardrails around powerful AI systems, especially those amplifying Global South representation like Centre for AI and Digital Policy (CAIDP) or Partnership on AI.¬†

15% to long-term, experimental bets - I believe we have a moral responsibility to take care of future generations. Investing in bets that are high-impact, neglected, but actionable. Organizations like Longview or EA funds can give access to ambitious projects that are well-reasoned and researched with a potential for exponential impact.

Ranking in order of priority:¬†

Personal fit with the idea - Mission alignment has consistently been the biggest driver in my career. It has sustained me through ambiguity and tough quarters. For example, at GiveDirectly, when market entry into India meant months of uncertainty, I only persisted because of my deep belief in the idea of unconditional cash. I‚Äôve lately been reflecting on my career, and recognize that a lot of my confidence as a leader stems from building deep expertise, ie knowing my subject inside out. Since I'm optimizing for the next decade of work, and putting my credibility on the line, personal fit is the only thing I know that can survive the pivots and the long-haul commitment.

Total addressable market ‚Äî I would like to optimize for scale in my venture. Scale might look different in for-profit and nonprofit settings: in the former, TAM might show up in dollar terms; in the latter, in the size of the underserved population that is able to create population-level or policy-level change. I‚Äôve had multiple internal debates about scale vs depth, and while both are valuable, at this moment in my career, scale is what excites me most. I want to work on a problem big enough to matter and solvable enough to move the needle significantly. And a high TAM is the best proxy for that ambition.

Demonstrated customer willingness to pay ‚Äî My preference is to work on ideas that solve a clear market gap, not a latent or speculative need; and customer‚Äôs ‚Äòrevealed preference‚Äô is an effective test. Specifically if these ideas won‚Äôt require major behavioral change or new habit formation, WTP either from donors or users would be sufficient to validate market readiness. I understand my preference means that I‚Äôm not in the business of moonshot bets or categoring-creating products, for now.

Number of competitors in the market - I actually see competition as a strategic advantage rather than a drawback. Since my preference is for proven problems and to achieve ecosytem-level impact, competition typically signals real demand, established customer behaviors, and a community of practitioners trying tackling the challenge from different angles. Competition also provides critical market intelligence on things that worked, failed and need to be improved. The power of cooperative competition or ‚Äòco-opetition‚Äô can mean shared gains in ecosystem and technical development, demand aggregation, coalition-building, and to raise the standard of service. My experience in the social impact has been to expand the pie with peers to achieve policy-level impact. However in the market, I‚Äôm confident in my ability to create differentiation to win a big share of the pie.
