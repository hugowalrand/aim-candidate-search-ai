 Domain Expertise 
 I don´t have experience in funding, but I have 10 years clinical experience in motivating mental ill people and my project idea meets an urgent topic.

For that amount I would do a lot of research in advance. Probably 30-50 k might be possible to donate if I would have enough financial reserves and securities and in dependence of my current costs of living. Usually I choose rainforest projects (buy forest, contribute to the work of ancient people), avaaz.org for funding specific projects or Doctors Without Borders. It´s important for me that the projects are not spending too much money on administration tasks, so the money could get almost directly to the places where it´s needed and that they are supporting long lasting, sustainable solutions.

A-B-D-C
If a person is passionate about the idea and her/his interests, knowledge, values, abilities and possibilities are fitting, something great can appear. If the value of the project is thriving the person he/she will get into her/his highest potential in all aspects to create an outstanding product which includes probably features and topics other people would not think about.
The total addressable market includes the scale and impact potential. If there is an outstanding product it will compete with lower quality products on the market.
Of course any project needs some budget and the customer willingness to pay for a helpful product is exceeding the opportunities to act and survive.
The Number of competitors in the market does matter a lot - it takes a lot more effort to compete with established companies, though I think it´s worth to try if there is an outstanding idea and you know their offer.
