 I had written a story about it, but it was over 1300 characters. Unfortunately, without the additional context, it's not going to make much sense.



N/A

This is a hard question to answer, even though I have thought about it (or variations of it) before. It does require making a few assumptions and a bit of speculation. Simply put though, I would like to make sure I am able to live well and plan for retirement. I reckon that, taking into account the current exchange rate and level of taxation in the UK, the current cost of living, and my desired standard of living, I could probably donate up to ¬£500 a month (~$660). That said, the more I donate, the more I would like to make sure that my donations are used effectively and not wasted on unnecessary things.

Regarding organisations, I've been making a small monthly donation to Scottish SPCA since 2018, and even though the work they do is important, I think they have a relatively small impact. I would still continue to support them though, but I would like to spread my donations across more impactful organisations with a larger reach as well. In the past, I have also made donations to Cats Protection, and engaged with PETA and Greenpeace on occasions. I would also like to support the work by Cruelty Free International and WWF. The reason I would support these organisations is that the work they do is quite aligned with my values, in terms of stopping animal suffering and promoting nature conservation, at least to the extent of my knowledge. Like many, I am guilty of not knowing all the details about the work these organisations carry out, and the methods they use, and there's always the risk that I won't agree with some things, or that I feel they don't go far enough. As I mentioned previously, if I were to make considerable donations, I would like to make the time to do proper research and choose the organisations that are better aligned with my values.

Finally, I just wanted to point out that I also care about a lot of other causes, e.g., making sure that everyone has access to clean water, food, shelter and education, ending domestic violence, addressing poverty, etc., but I feel conservation efforts and animal welfare are closer to my heart.



A - D - B - C

I think personal fit is one of the most important factors. However, I think not having a suitable background shouldn't be a deal breaker. You can always learn if you are passionate about the mission. Of course, it would be ideal if you could hit the ground running, but this is not always possible. For example, I have lots of ideas that I find daunting because I feel I don't have the necessary domain knowledge, but if I found someone with complementary skills that was also passionate about solving the same problem, then I wouldn't hesitate. However, if you are not passionate about the idea, then it's very unlikely that you will find the necessary motivation and discipline to push forward when things get tough, and they will. This is the case with some of my ideas. They feel achievable, but the spark is just not there.

The second most important factor in my opinion is having customers willing to pay for what you are offering. No matter how good what you are offering is, if nobody is willing to pay for it, then, it's a no go.

The total addressable market gives you an indication of the potential for scaling the business, and therefore, it's quite important.

I chose the number of competitors in the market as the least important factor because I believe that if you are able to differentiate yourself from the competition in some meaningful way, then it doesn't really matter how many competitors there are. Quite the opposite, the existence of competitors is a good indicator that there is a market. Of course, if there are no competitors, then you should ask yourself why that's the case. Is it because people are not interested or because it's just a very hard problem with no known solutions? The first question should be addressed by the previous two points. If you have determined that people are willing to pay, and that the total addressable market is large enough, then you have established that there is interest in your product or service. The second question is a bit more tricky. However, recently I heard some (perhaps unintuitive) piece of advice suggesting that we should focus on building something that doesn't yet work. With the current pace of progress, chances are that soon enough, the technology required for your offering to work will become available, and by having built most of your product already, you'll have a competitive advantage. So the question turns into how confident you are that a solution to the problem will be found in time for your company to be able to profit. This is particularly relevant for products based on LLMs and related technologies, but it can certainly be extended to other technologies as well.
