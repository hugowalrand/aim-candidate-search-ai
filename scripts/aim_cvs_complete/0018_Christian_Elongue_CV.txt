Crowdfunding

If I made that amount per year, I'd give at least 25%, which is 37 500$ to charity. This is something I do already through my company Kabod Group, where we corporately support missionary, social impact and charity organisations through our profits.¬†

As an individual, the organisations I'm currently supporting are:

1. Christ Embassy Church: Because it's my church and prints the first devotional in the world, bringing salvation message to billions.

2. Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, for their gospel outreaches and initiatives globally through Samiritan Purse etc.¬†

3. One Way Africa (OWA), for their missionary projects to translate the Bible in Ghanaian languages.

4. Koinonia International of Apostle Joshua Selman, whose teachings have greatly blessed me.

5. Health and educational organisations who have proven impact on communities.¬†

My ranking is the following:

A. Personal fit with idea: companies rise and fall on the quality of the founder(s) or the people driving it.¬†

D: Demonstrated customer willingness to pay. I've seen startup with good products or services but no or not enough revenue or sales, forcing them to close after raising millions through investment or grants. That was recently the case for Iroko TV in Nigeria.¬†

B: The total addressable market matters because it influence the level of income you can generate solving that problem. Peter Thiel for example, only focus on problems with large TAM. I often think it's important but as a Christian, I also think that it's ok to tackle a problem with a small TAM if it can have a strong social impact on people or communities. As a social entrepreneur, I'd often focus on the problem that is aligned with my life purpose, whether the addressable market is big, medium or small. In as much as profit matters, it's not higher than alignment with purpose. I'd choose to focus on what God wants me to do. For example, my purpose is connected to impacting children and I've been dedicated to that through Munakalati.org for the past 11 years, founding the only NGO that focuses exclusively on creating and distributing afrocentric content for children, because I believe it's important for kids to not only know who they are, but also to love who they are. And this can only come through a solid cultural and historic understanding provided through the content or knowledge they are exposed to at an early age.¬†

C: the number of competitors in a market is the least important because of the power of innovation. As a highly creative, resilient and determined person, I believe it's possible to beat competition through a planned strategy. And the number of competitors won't deter me if I fully understand the market and how my solution can be of added value.¬†
