 Management, Startup Experience 
 In 2017, I packed my SUV and moved from California to Maryland without knowing anyone. It was one of the hardest and most transformative decisions I‚Äôve made‚Äîpushing me to grow, adapt to a new environment, and build community from the ground up.

I have not raised any funding

If I made $150,000 USD per year, I would donate up to 10% of my salary. As someone who grew up in poverty and is still managing student loan debt, a higher income would come with increased responsibilities, including supporting my family. That said, I would prioritize giving to organizations I know and trust‚Äîspecifically, Impact Hub Baltimore, Dent Education, Black Yield Institute, and The Baltimore Beat‚Äîbecause I‚Äôve seen firsthand the powerful and transformative work they‚Äôre doing in my community.

I rank the four factors in order from most to least important as D,B,A,C. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay is the strongest sign that the problem is real and the solution has tangible value‚Äîit's the clearest market validation. Total addressable market follows, because even with early traction, the broader potential determines whether a solution can scale and sustain long-term impact. Personal fit is still important‚Äîfounders who are genuinely connected to the issue are more likely to stay committed‚Äîbut without demand or scale potential, passion alone isn't enough. The number of competitors is least important; a crowded space can mean high demand, and differentiation often matters more than being first or alone.
