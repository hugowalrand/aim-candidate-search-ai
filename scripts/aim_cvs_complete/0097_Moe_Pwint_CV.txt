 I raised funds through private donations to provide safe houses, evacuate people from life-threatening danger and execution by the Myanmar military, and support underground activism. I also worked with a group persuading military personnel to leave the army to reduce bloodshed.

I led the effort by reaching out to donors, and ensuring transparent use of funds to support mental health services for the Burmese war-affected community.

If I earned $150,000 USD per year, I would donate approximately 10‚Äì15% of my income, around $15,000 to $22,500, to causes that directly support vulnerable communities and mental health initiatives. Specifically, I would contribute to organizations like Back Pack Health Worker Team, and National Mental Health Federation led by psychiatrists who participated in Civil Disobedience Movement¬†for mental health support, and Doctors Without Borders for emergency medical care, because these groups provide critical services to those most in need and emphasize sustainable, community-centered impact.

Demonstrated customer willingness to pay is the most critical because even the best idea will fail if customers are not willing to pay for it. Validated demand is a direct signal that the startup can generate revenue and sustain itself.

    *   Personal fit with idea comes next because the founder‚Äôs skills, experience, and passion strongly influence execution, resilience, and ability to pivot under challenges.

    *   Total addressable market is important as it indicates growth potential, but a large market alone does not guarantee success if the product-market fit is weak.

    *   Number of competitors in the market is least important because competition can indicate a healthy market; startups can differentiate, innovate, and still succeed despite competitors.
