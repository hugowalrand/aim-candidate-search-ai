 I have a network of people that are open to invite me to their house¬† in 35+ countries.

It is easy to pick a large share as I am currently well off with my lower cost student budget. However, realistically with 12500 dollars per month and perhaps 7000 dollars per month net, I would invest 1500 in funds as a way of saving for the future. 1250 dollars, 10%, I would donate to various charities - most of whom have played a crucial role - in shaping me and in this hypothetical scenario - in allowing me to have a 150k salary.¬†  

I would donate these 1250 dollars equally across the domains of:¬†  
- Ehemaligenstiftung and Alumni Verein Hansenberg - not just my alma mater, but a place that fundamentally shaped me over the three years I was a boarding school student. These donations contribute to making these experiences possible for students with less resources¬†  
- Usiko Stellenbosch - my entry point to social impact in many ways - having volunteered there on three different occasions I have been fascinated by the first hand impact I could perceive. The staff and beneficiaries are immensely grateful and shaped my view on the world in a very positive way.¬†  
- BioCarbon Partners - as somewhat of a frequent traveler I support a carbon offsetting programme that is incredibly effective in reforesting Zambia connecting various nature reservoirs and not just sucking carbon out of the air but benefitting wildlife and local residents in many ways. Back in 2022 I had the chance to work on two consulting projects for the organization

D) demonstrated customer willingness to pay comes first for me as it is fundamental for any kind of business to be viable to sustain in the long run. Even with a small market, if a company has customers with a High WTP it can be quite successful.¬†  

A) Personal fit with the idea would come second for me. Given the length of the startup journey, to signal trust, convince partners and customers and build stronger relationships, a strong fit is an important foundation. Otherwise I see the risk of burning out or pivoting early.¬†  

B) TAM - a large audience is important but less than the WTP and personal idea fit. Especially in the impact space in developing countries were customers have less disposable income, a large market size would be crucial. However, I also realize that many successful companies started in a niche and expanded their product from there.  

C) I rank number of competitors the fourth most important factor given that it is difficult to strike the right balance. Too few competitors could be a sign that the idea is less relevant than expected. Too many competitors can be a signal for a stronger need for differentiation.
