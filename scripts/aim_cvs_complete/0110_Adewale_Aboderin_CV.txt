Ranking 

I will rank it in these following way;

D,B,A,C

Reasoning 

The most critical factor is D, without this,even the best ideas will fail.

Next is the B.if the idea works,I will want to know if there is enough people or businesses for my solution.

Then comes with my personal fit and the last is the least important at the early stage.
