 Domain Expertise, Management 
 After much procrastination, I recently completed an outline for a book I have been planning for some time. The book explores how anyone can use the philosophical 'method' to create their own 'micro-philosophy', ie. an ordered system ideas by which to live an interpret the world.

In a previous startup I raised a small amount of money (AUD 10K) from a private investor, and a further (AUD 5K) from crowdfunding

Advanced AI systems will have a massive impact on humanity and potentially pose global catastrophic risks. I believe that resolving the tension between the risks and opportunities created by these systems will be the defining political and humanitarian challenge of our time. With that in mind, I would donate USD 5,000 to the EA Long-Term Future Fund which makes grants that address potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence (amongst other things).

I am particularly interested in the concept of 'human centric' AI and how it can be effectively expressed within regulatory frameworks. I'm particularly interested in the work of Herbert Marcuse who analysed how technology was being weaponised as a form of social control, entrenching principles of technological rationality and creating a single unchallenged system of thought and behaviour. It is important that such concerns remain part of the policy conversation in order to ensure that AI development is aligned with human values and interests. One relatively new organisation that I believe is doing some pioneering work in this space is the Cosmos Institute who run the Human-Centred AI Lab at the University of Oxford. I would donate USD 2,500 to that organisation.

I am also passionate about animal welfare - another key and often neglected issue. I would split a further USD 2,500 between two highly effective animal charities: the Humane League and Animal Ethics.

(D) Demonstrated willingness to pay. This is the most critical factor as it provides the most direct and concrete evidence that the startup is solving a real, valuable problem.¬†

(B) Total addressable market (TAM). The size of hte market is an important determinant of the startup's potential scale, but it is less important than the initial validation of the idea.

(A) Personal fit with the idea. Studies have shown that a startups success is highly dependent on the passion and unique insight of the founders. I ranked this lower than (D) and (B) because, whilst important, no amount of passion and 'personal fit' will overcome a lack of product-market fit or a small addressable market.

(C) Number of competitors in the market. Whilst a crowded market can negatively affect prospects of success, it can also indicate that the market is large, that the problem is real and that customers are willing to spend money to address it.
