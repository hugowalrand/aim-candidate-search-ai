 I at some point while growing up built a shelf-life structure.... we can call it a cage of some sort for animals..

We sourced for funds to keep the startup running basically from organizations aiding programs. Some came as Grants others as partnership contracts.

I should be able to donate $15000...  I believe giving out 10% of earnings yield even 90% of returns. 😁... I cant say there are specific Organizations  at hand but any Orphanage Organizations could be a priority as to making sure the kids should have a chance at life too.
