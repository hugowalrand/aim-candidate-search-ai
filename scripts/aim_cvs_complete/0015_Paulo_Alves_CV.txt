 I'll admit- it's a little tricky for me to answer this question in a way that is both authentic and¬†makes me feel as though I'm representing the kind of spirit that you're trying to cultivate in this program.

Because the truth is that I've made more than $150k/year gross for a while and have been averaging a donation rate of 

In ascending order of importance:

4. (C) Number of competitors in the market

I wouldn't place too much stock in this. A market with many many competitors can indicate that no one has quite figured out how to execute well. A market with little competition may have entrenched players. In that case, I'd want a clear thesis as to why we think we could outcompete them with, but that's not unreasonable (see: the innovator's dilemma).



3.¬†(B) Total addressable market





A market that's too small to sustain a business (or draw requisite funding) would be a deal-breaker. Beyond that, I don't think it matters too much. Whenever I hear a pitch in the style of "if we corner just 1% of this giant market" I roll my eyes, because I think it tends to incorrectly presume that a small market share of a very large market is somehow easily attainable.

2.¬†(A) Personal fit with idea

A startup is a big commitment, so I'd like to make sure I'm picking an endeavor that I believe in and¬†suites my skillset. Plus: having a good founder-market fit narrative can be helpful in getting funding

  



1.¬†(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay



Market validation is the difference between an idea for a piece of software that could exist and a plan for building an actual company. I imagine most of my time/effort spent evaluating startup ideas would be discovering whether customers are willing to pay for stuff as quickly as possible (a la the Lean Startup)
