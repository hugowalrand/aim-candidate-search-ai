 Domain Expertise, Management 
 I am proud of taking action for others. I travelled to eastern Ukraine during the 2nd year of Russia's invasion to document the work of Ibereco pro bono.  

I would donate 20% of my annual income to charities that work in domains with unprecedented impact on humanity in the future.
1.  Space is the new frontier where geopolitics, security, and innovation collide. While climate forecasts, scientific research, and communication technology are undoubtedly big wins, we also find ourselves amid an unprecedented space race for profit, power, and security concerns by private and state entities. The Secure World Foundation has led research, policy development, and advocacy work in service of a more secure and sustainable use of space. They develop urgently needed frameworks, guidelines, and reports that tackle these pressing issues. 
2. Most of us live and work (if we want to or not) within a new economy, where data is a resource to be mined and profited from – with little to no concerns for its long-term implications.  I believe that unregulated tech power and the complex, social consequences of ICTs and AI pose the key threat to democracies worldwide. As this dynamic unfolds at immense speed, it is more important than ever to get ahead of this development. This requires more public awareness, more research, and more regulation. The AI Now Institute is working at precisely this intersection. 


3. ClientEarth, for effectively using legal action for people and the planet. In doing so, they have not only made ecological threats tangible and consequential, but have also changed the way corporations, governments and the public think about the interconnection between human rights and ecological rights. 


I would also donate 15% of my annual income to the following charities that I continuously support:
1. Sea-Watch, for their dedication to migrant rescue and upholding international law where states fail. 
2. Reporters without Borders, for their pivotal work as a pillar for press freedom. Persecuted journalists and media workers require support and safety more than ever. The fight against censorship through documentation and awareness building, but also safe relocation and legal support requires more support from civil society and democratic governments.  
##### 3. Planet Narratives is tackling the climate crisis through the power of storytelling and creativity. I believe in the impact of inspiration and good narratives. Our brains are evolutionarily wired for storytelling and problem-solving through imagination. I would love to support them in helping more filmmakers (and other narrative-driven storytellers) navigate the super soft power of storytelling for transformation.

C Number of competitors: Will determine the success rate and positioning of the start-up

A Personal fit: The better the fit, the higher the dedication for growth and making it work

D Demonstrated willingness to pay: Willingness to pay can change depending on the offering, the positioning and communication
