 Domain Expertise, Management, Startup Experience 
 I am really proud that my two children (9&6) tend to be the kids who comfort others when they need it. My son was at camp and there was a thunderstorm a few days ago and he reassured a fellow camper who was crying. My kids don't care about status; they care about connection.

I would donate around $15,000. I would donate ~3/4 of that to Children International and Doctors Without Borders because they are very efficient organizations reaching countries I cannot reach otherwise. I would also spread the other ~1/4 to Hand-in-Hand: The Domestic Employers Network, Brooklyn Public Library, WNYC, Sandy Hook Promise, and Urban Green, because I have direct experience with them and hopes for their potential impact on my chosen community. I would also donate to WETS in Northeast Tennessee to make sure good reporting gets to my former home and that of my family of origin.

I am a mid-career domain expert (architecture, design, construction), so I have to rank (A) first. I do not intend to abandon my architecture and construction career; I want to leverage it. Next, I would probably rank (C) second, because I think it's important to find and serve a niche that isn't being served and frankly because I think I would find fighting for market share with a bunch of similar businesses boring. Then, I would rank (B) third because one of my motivations in starting a new company, in addition to the architecture practice I already run, is to have a larger impact. My team and I can only serve so many clients per year and only certain clients are serious about sustainable and social impact, but if I'm involved in developing a technology that can be shared nationally or world-wide, the impact would be so much larger. I tend to have a product and systems mindset and am eager to do less direct client service work for affluent clients and more product development for the full income spectrum involved in the construction industry. And finally, I rank (D) last because I believe a lack of demonstrated customer willingness to pay is surmountable when new systems are introduced! It might even be indicative of a space where impact could occur. The key would be to get a minimum viable product out fast and tweak it until we feel the evidence is strong enough to help secure funding rounds.
