 EA Giving Tuesday 2021

If I earned $150,000 USD per year, I would aim to donate 10‚Äì20% annually. I would direct these funds through trusted philanthropic advisors like Longview Philanthropy or to expert-recommended funds such as the GiveWell Top Charities Fund and Open Philanthropy's suggested grantees.

Given that my comparative advantage likely lies elsewhere, it‚Äôs not a good use of my time to conduct in-depth charity evaluations myself. I‚Äôm not confident I‚Äôd outperform experts who specialize in this work full-time, and learning to do it well would take significant time which I could instead use to increase my earnings or create more impact through my core work. Relying on expert evaluators allows me to donate effectively, without sacrificing other areas where I can contribute meaningfully.

BCDA  
I prioritized total addressable market first because the scale of the problem or opportunity directly affects potential impact. If we‚Äôre working on a high-leverage area, the value of solving it is significantly greater. Next, I considered the number of competitors. While competition can be healthy, in the context of limited resources and high-impact entrepreneurship, working on problems that are neglected or underserved often leads to more meaningful contributions. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay comes next, as it reflects sustainability and viability, but can often be tested and refined over time. Finally, personal fit is important for long-term motivation, but in an impact-first setting, it‚Äôs secondary to whether the idea addresses a critical and underserved need.
