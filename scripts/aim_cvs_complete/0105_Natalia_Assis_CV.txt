 Domain Expertise, Management 
 I am proud of my journey and what it represents for my friends and family. I am proud of never having deviated from my values, even when others and the system did.  

I would love to make English as a Second Language (ESL) more accessible to young professionals in developing countries. Cherishing my representativeness of many different groups (e.g. women, students from low-income backgrounds, international and multilingual students, athletes, first-generation students, Brazilians, Latinos, Afro-Latinos, etc), my background and experiences, along with my strong belief in the transformative power of education, I wish to continue stearing my life efforts towards opportunies that allow me to identify, create, and implement innovative solutions to maximize students’ success, and support the mission of education in ways that are inclusive, positive, and collaborative. I would start in Brazil due to my expertise in the culture, as well as other social and financial advantages. With a $150,000 USD yearly salary, I would be comfortable donating 25k to 50k.

(A) Personal fit with idea (B) Total addressable market (D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay (C) Number of competitors in the market 

Personal fit comes first for internal long-term motivation. Competitors last because I would aim to be the differential.
