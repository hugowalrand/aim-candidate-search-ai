 Domain Expertise, Management, Startup Experience 
 Building with my wife a wonderful family with 4 kids.

I founded and run a community project for 13 years, where we lend out, free of charge, a variety of equipment¬†(folding tables, chairs, a projector, a large projection screen, and more)¬†mostly for happy events.

VC funding, angels, EU call. Found the investors, prepared most of the materials and led the presentations / applications,

I would donate about 5% of my salary, mainly to charities that have direct impact and results of improving or saving the life of people in crises and charities that operate activities and have direct impact on current and future life of youth and young adults.

A. building a start up is a very challenging journey to say the least and if as a founder the idea of the start up does not personally fir your values, passion and other aspects of life, the chances to succeed is close to zero.

B. without income the start up will rarely succeed in the long term. The willingness to pay also is a benchmark the the start up creates value for a costumer. It's not required to demonstrate from day 1 the willingness to pay for the exact product of the start up, but it's a need to show willingness to pay for same need, value or belief. This is also relevant to non-profit orgs.

C. the market has to be big enough that the start up can scale and become a profitable company.

D. Competitors is a signal of a vibrant market and can drive the start up to improve.¬†
