 Domain Expertise, Management 
 ##### Early in my career, I supported legal cases for underage victims of sex crimes, ensuring their cases were prosecuted. Then, I started a lunch program that provided balanced, affordable meals to primary school children in my community.

Angel investors to transform the NGO to a company.

*   Sinergia Animal, the animal cause is very close to my heart. Sinergia has proven year after year how a well-executed strategy can achieve results. I would give $8,000.00.

    *   LEEP, lead exposure in daily life opens the door to a health crisis. LEEP‚Äôs intervention in strategic markets provides the foundation to bring this menace to the table and drive action. I would give $3,000.00

    *   High Impact Professionals,¬† their program helped me plan for the future, and I would love to see it expand to other languages. I would give $1,500.00.

    *   Laboratorio Emprendimiento Social, a Latin American organization helping people in the region create cost-effective interventions. I would give $1,500.00.

    *   Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature (GARN), a grassroots global movement to provide rights to nature. Although their effectiveness hasn‚Äôt been measured, I believe small amounts should also be considered for grassroots organizations. I would give $1,000.00.

    

1. Personal fit with the idea. I am driven by purpose and values. I will not enter a market, no matter how profitable, if it involves ecosystem destruction, harm to animals, or loss of human rights.

    2. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay. You can have an excellent product, but if customers are not willing to pay for it, it is useless.

    3. Total addressable market. This is fundamental to understanding the scalability of the business.

    4. Number of competitors in the market. For me, this is the least important factor because it mainly validates points 2 and 3. It also indicates a product that can be improved to capture a fraction of the market.
