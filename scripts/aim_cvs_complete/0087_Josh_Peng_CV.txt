 Management, Startup Experience 
 I became a camp counsellor for burns survivor kids, and part of a broader community of adult burn survivors. After working as a peer support worker at my university's recovery program, I am now volunteering to build an adult burn survivor peer support community.

I would donate approx. 10 000 USD / year to the BC Burn Fund, which I have personal connection to. In this scenario, I assume that along my career path I would have continued to make impact and work on initiatives within the foundation I have seen and believed in.¬†  

I would also donate 7 500 USD / year to a local effective altruism group in Vancouver affiliated with Effective Altruism Global. Locally grown effective altruism sentiments in major Canadian cities is severely lacking. I'm informed by Francis Fukuyama's work on trust in societies and institutions; there is a cultural appetite for doing hardworking good in Canada's metropolitan industries.¬† I believe starting camps for promising youth coming from hardworking and education-oriented immigrant families in a city like Vancouver (where I grew up) can create so much exponential good.

D, A, B, C

D - Real paid demand is the signal there is money-making potential. Proof of concepts, pre-orders and solid surveying would be my motivation.

A - Working with a "dream team" would have to entail domain knowledge and proven stamina. Also, convincing aspects of personal fit would lead to a belief in multiple years of longevity.

B - Sort of building on D, realistic services marked by growth trends and projections determines the true ultimate upside for this start-up.¬†  

C - Competition means there is a market with potential partnerships, scalable weaknesses and strength, but leaning into less competition can also be a signal of good knowledge and personal fit. There will be larger opportunity that may just coincide with a lucky and wise team to enter.
