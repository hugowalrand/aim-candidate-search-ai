 Domain Expertise, Management 
 I returned to college in September 2020, and graduated in May of 2024 with a BA in Global Security and International Relations. I have a complicated history with school in general, so I consider going back, and graduating magna while working full time to be a huge personal win.

N/A

I am not a wealthy man, and the cost of living in Boston is high. And, while I would continue to donate 1 to 2 percent of my salary, as I have done for some years now, I would also continue to give something I believe far more valuable: my time and my expertise.

Over the years, I have worked closely with independent grocers, food cooperatives, and mission-driven nonprofits, helping them navigate digital transformation, market pressures, and strategic planning. When possible, I‚Äôve done this work pro bono, offering guidance in areas such as business development, marketing, narrative development, and consensus building. These organizations often operate with limited resources while striving to make a large impact on their communities, and I‚Äôve found that targeted support and strategic insight can produce a far greater impact than money alone.

Looking ahead, I‚Äôm actively building expertise in artificial intelligence with the goal of expanding the kinds of problems I can help solve, and the communities I can serve. AI can offer enormous benefits to under-resourced organizations, but only if they have access to people who can help them understand and use it. I want to be one of those people.

That said, I would still give charitably, supporting GiveWell-recommended organizations whose transparent, data-driven approach to global health and poverty alleviation I deeply respect. I would also contribute to politicians, both local and national, who are committed to strengthening democratic institutions and advancing policy grounded in integrity and evidence. In this moment, I believe political giving is one of the most leveraged forms of charitable action available.

In short, while my financial donations would remain thoughtful and focused, the core of my giving will continue to be personal, direct, and deeply engaged. I believe generosity should be measured not just in dollars, but in effort and intention. And I plan to keep showing up wherever I can do the most good.

1. Personal fit - not much to explain here. Founding requires extraordinary commitment, and I don't believe that's truly possible without "fit."  
2. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay - money is the lifeblood of organizations, and that money has to come from somewhere.

3. Tie between addressable mark and number of competitors - and I would add how effective those competitors are. Successful founding requires either the ability to disrupt established competitors, or the ability to carve out a niche or market segment that isn't yet well served by the existing players in the space.
