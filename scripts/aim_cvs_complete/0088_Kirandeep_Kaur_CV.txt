I would donate upto 10% of my salary to charities that work at local level in order to improve the lives of people and/or animals in the area it operates in. For me its highly important to promote a Non profit run by passionate group of people who care about the cause they are working for but are limited by finances to run their operations.

Thirdly, for me is important that the business is operating in a growing market with some healthy competition proving a growing need and scalability.
