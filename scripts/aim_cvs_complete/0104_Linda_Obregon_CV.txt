 Domain Expertise, Management 
 At 12, living with my nanny while my parents emigrated, I struggled with stuttering. With few resources, I searched online (in 2002) and found a simple program with daily exercises. After three months of practice, I stopped stuttering, and it felt so great to finally be able to communicate my ideas.

Angel investors, VC, and government grants. I led the fundraising, I was responsible for developing the pitch deck, identifying and approaching investors, delivering pitches, and negotiating terms.

I would donate 10 - 15% of my income to animal welfare organizations that focus not only on short-term wins but also on systemic, sustainable change and neglected species. This would include the Albert Schweitzer Foundation, for its evidence-based campaigns that improve conditions for broilers, turkeys, and aquatic animals, as well as promote alternative proteins. Also, ARBA Peru executes cost-effective interventions for hens while collaborating with producers to sustain demand and policy change (they haven't been evaluated by ACE and have limited access to funding).

Neither organization is currently part of ACE‚Äôs recommended charities, as ACE tends to focus on short-term wins, while these groups prioritize long-term structural impact and self-fund some of their initiatives

1.D; 2.A, 3.B, 4.C  

- All four matter, but the most important is getting the money, customer willingness to pay. If I‚Äôm building a company, I need proof that the problem is painful enough for people to pay for a solution, ideally one that saves them more money (time) than my price. For example, vegans without access to good meat alternatives are happy to pay for something affordable and tasty.  
- Second, I'd choose a market/problem where I have unique information/knowledge or access to it. AI can provide general knowledge, but it can‚Äôt replace unique insights or lived experience. If I understand the pain point and know the industry deeply, I can move faster and make better decisions. When I worked on alternative proteins, I had both: I experienced the problem, knew the sector, and had the connections and experience for fundraising.  
- Third, market size. Even if the idea is validated, a tiny market won‚Äôt scale. Ideally, I‚Äôd choose a solution that can grow fast and expand globally. Physical products are tough here (scaling can erode price advantages, quality and lose of control over processes).  
- Last, competitors. Being first looks good in headlines, but customers pick the best solution (quality and price), not the first. Competition often is good, it means there‚Äôs a real market, what matters is differentiation a good product and being able to reach them.  

In short: validate demand, ensure founder-market fit, and target a market big enough to scale.
