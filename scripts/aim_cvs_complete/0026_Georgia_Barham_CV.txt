 Domain Expertise, Management 
 







I led the communications for the UK‚Äôs largest and most profitable student-run event whilst at Durham Uni, raising ¬£171K for two charities. I directed a multi-channel campaign and built strategic partnerships with sponsors, university leadership, vendors, and beneficiaries.

I currently donate 10% of my income in keeping with my Christian principles. Were I to earn $150,000 USD, I would scale my giving to 20%‚Äîabout $30,000 per year‚Äîwhile still maintaining a healthy savings buffer and covering my cost of living. This commitment reflects my conviction that generosity should grow with capacity. By consciously living below my means, I can ensure that surplus resources are directed toward causes where I‚Äôve witnessed real, measurable impact and that align with my deepest values.  
The Felix Project: Rescuing Food & Nourishing Communities:¬†I would allocate $10,000 annually to The Felix Project, a London charity that rescues high-quality surplus food and redistributes it to schools, shelters, and community groups. In London alone, the city in which I love, tens of thousands of families face food insecurity every week, even as tons of edible food go to waste. Having volunteered alongside their teams on collection runs, I admire the Project‚Äôs logistical expertise and unwavering commitment to treating recipients with dignity. Their model not only prevents food waste - a key issue in itself - but also fuels community kitchens, after-school clubs, and holiday meal programs‚Äîdelivering hope, nutrition, and a stronger safety net for those in need.
The Girls‚Äô Network: Empowering Young Women Through Mentorship:¬†I would direct $10,000 each year to The Girls‚Äô Network, where I have served as a mentor for two consecutive years. Education is power, and this charity‚Äôs one-to-one pairing of teenage girls from underrepresented backgrounds with professional women has proven transformational. Through regular sessions, I‚Äôve watched mentees overcome self-doubt, build resumes, secure internships, and, in several cases, gain acceptance to top universities. Investing in mentorship is investing in long-term social mobility‚Äîamplifying the potential of young women who might otherwise lack guidance, role models, or confidence to pursue ambitious career paths.
GiveDirectly: Strengthening Global Family Ties:¬†I would commit $10,000 annually to GiveDirectly, which offers low-cost, transparent cash transfers to families in need worldwide. A close colleague relies on GiveDirectly to send money home to his relatives in East Africa, and I‚Äôve observed firsthand how the service‚Äôs minimal fees and real-time tracking maximise the support his family receives. By championing GiveDirectly‚Äôs infrastructure, I would help uphold the dignity and agency of migrant workers and their loved ones, ensuring that every dollar sent truly reaches its intended impact‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs funding school expenses, improving housing, or covering urgent medical costs.
By dividing my donations across food security, youth empowerment, and global financial justice, I would channel 20% of my income into partnerships that deliver targeted, measurable outcomes. This approach honors my faith-driven values and my belief in strategic philanthropy: leveraging privilege to foster sustainable change, amplify underheard voices, and build bridges across communities. Committing to this level of giving is not merely an obligation‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to translate gratitude into action and to inspire others to do the same.  




1. (D) Demonstrated Customer Willingness to Pay - this has to come first as it is the ultimate validation of a startup idea. If customers are actually paying, then we have proven real market demand‚Äînot just interest. It de-risks the business early and provides cash flow and traction which are absolutely crucial. Even a smaller market or crowded space becomes viable if people are lining up ready to engage.

  

2. (A) Personal Fit with Idea. For me, this comes next as startups are a marathon, not a sprint. Personal fit ensures that I as the founder has the passion, knowledge, and resilience to push through inevitable setbacks. Even a great idea can flounder if the founder isn‚Äôt deeply aligned, and it is this alignment that commands my application to this mission-led accelerator. Plus, it is key to fundrasing since investors often bet on the founder more than the idea itself.

  

3. (B) Total Addressable Market (TAM). This is what unlocks our bigger long term growth - a large TAM means potential for scale, which excites investors and brings opportunity. That said, it's only useful if we can access that market, and so a modest TAM with clear demand can outperform a massive one that‚Äôs hard to reach. So while important, it comes third to actual traction and founder fit.

  

4. (C) Number of Competitors in the Market. I think competition matters‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker. A competitive market often signals a healthy demand. What matters more is our differentiation. A startup with demonstrated customer traction can thrive even in crowded spaces if its edge is clear (e.g., niche focus, better customer experience, pricing, tech moat). This is especially true for impact led ventures - the world is a big place and full of opportunity to do good!
