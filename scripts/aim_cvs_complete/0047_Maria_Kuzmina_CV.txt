 Domain Expertise, Management, Startup Experience 
 As a kid I was super shy but good at basketball, dancing, and reciting poems, so I was recruited for the sports, theater and dancing simultaneously. Facing the audience was a nightmare, but I learnt to push myself through it. I’m proud to have had those experiences, it made my life more exciting. 

As a Senior Legal Manager working at an investment fund, I prepared and managed documentation (term sheets, SPAs, convertible loans/SAFEs), and data room on investment deals into fund’s portfolio companies. I also sat in on negotiations when our portfolio companies raised investments from external angel investors, ensuring that deals closed on beneficial terms.

I am interested in long-term goals and creating systemic change, so I aim to take the 10% pledge and donate USD15k to a meta-charity such as GiveWell. I believe they set the highest standards for research and analysis, amplify resources, invest in highly cost-effective causes and that their activities are transparent and data-driven.

1. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

This is crucial - if no one pays, then the product is not a for-profit business. If customers are excited about a free product, it does not necessarily mean that they will pay when it’s not for free anymore, so the repeated willingness to pay is the major indicator of profitability.

2. Personal fit with idea

Founder market fit ensures that the startup will have an unfair advantage over competitors in terms of execution, deeper and faster understanding of customer pain, direct network reach, and fist-hand industry insights. In my case my unfair advantage is combined knowledge across several of domains: legal services, cultural and creative production, education, grants. Personal fit is also manifested in mission alignment, grit, bias for action. As the start-up pivots, ideas may change but the highest counterfactual impact for a founder is to engage in what they are best fit for.

3. Total addressable market

This shows whether the idea is scalable and open for rapid growth, thus venture capital investment is possible (USD 1bn+ TAM). 

4. Number of competitors in the market

The lack of competitors would be a red flag signaling a tarpit idea customers will never pay for often because the timing or market is not right. Too many competitors, on the other hand, signify a demand but also an oversaturated market (which can be penetrated if the product is sufficiently differentiated). But this is of secondary concern after customers’ interest and founder-problem fit are confirmed because the interest will show the willingness to pay and founder’s fit will ensure strong execution.
