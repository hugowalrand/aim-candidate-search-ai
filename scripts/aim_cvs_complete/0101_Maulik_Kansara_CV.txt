 Domain Expertise, Management 
 I am so much proud of my commitment in voluntary donating blood and SDP, having donated 37 times. I believe this simple act of selfless had a significant life-saving impact and I felt it was a meaningful way to contribute towards health and well-being of others

I have not raised any commercial funding

If I earned $150000 USD per year, I would wish to donate 10% of my annual income, i.e. $15000 to charity. I believe in idea of giving back to the society. Growing up, my grandparents taught me that no matter how much you earn, it‚Äôs important to give some of it back to the community. After following Effective Altruism, I am also motivated by the principles of the Effective Altruism and believe in doing good, better. I would donate some amount to uplift my community and majority of the amount I would donate to Suvita, an NGO that works on sending vaccine remainders SMS in India. I would particularly donate to Suvita because I am so much impressed by the work they are doing in a cost-effective manner. Suvita works to increase the childhood immunization rates in India. Even though childhood vaccination is free in government clinics, many parents either forget when to take their child or don‚Äôt know how important the vaccination is. Suvita solves this by sending SMS reminders messages to parents before their child‚Äôs vaccination is due. They also have immunisation ambassadors, who share information with new parents in their community about local vaccine clinics. They work in coordination with the health programs that are already run by the government. And they‚Äôve already helped many families by sending remainders to the parents about when their child‚Äôs vaccination is due. I‚Äôm so much impressed by the work they‚Äôre doing and how effectively they‚Äôre doing it. What I really like about Suvita is that they use low-cost solutions that can reach a lot of people. They do this in a cost-effective way maximizing the use per dollar. I would choose to support Suvita because they are doing it quite well. They are working to solve a critical health issue in a cost-effective and sustainable way and with the support, I believe they can reach many more children and can expand their programme. So, I would donate most of my charity income to Suvita.



The rankings are done from most important to least important.



Total addressable market:- The charity start up should be such that it can help lots of people or animals. If the start up is working on small problem, then it would not reach many beneficiaries. If we do a start up on bigger problems, then we can have a huge and large impact on the beneficiaries.
Personal fit with idea:- It is second important because I believe that starting and successfully running a charity start up is a challenging process and one should really care about their cause and should be passionate about the work even when sometimes the things may go out of hands. One should personally fit into the start up idea they are working on it
Number of competitors in the market:- It is third important as competition does not matters in a charity start up. Other charities working on same idea indicates that the problem is important. By working on same idea, we can reach large number of beneficiaries
Demonstrated customer willingness to pay:- This is the least important in a charity start up because the beneficiaries of these would be those who cannot pay or afford to pay. The charities work for the beneficiaries, not to make money from them but to make their life better and they receive their funds from donors and so this factor is least important
