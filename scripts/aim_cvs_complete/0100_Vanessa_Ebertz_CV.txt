 Domain Expertise 
 When I was 18 I talked a stranger out of hanging himself on an overpass in Edmonton, Alberta. It was before cell phones so I flagged a cab to call for police help and while waiting for police, I kept the man in distress company while trying to plan to catch him should he jump. It ended well.

N/A

II would donate a minimum of 10% to GiveWell for health initiative such as preventing Malaria. Melinda Gates' The Moment of Lift was eye opening to see the related needs when working on a specific charity (IE family planning to women's equality). I love seeing the connections and supporting the roots of the issues with effective charities.
