I'm proud to have founded Political Pay Rate, an initiative dedicated to making political salary data publicly accessible, sparking crucial conversations on pay equity, promoting informed career choices, and holding political organizations accountable for fair compensation practices.





























If I earned $150,000 USD per year, I'd aim to donate at least 10% ($15,000) annually to organizations making meaningful impacts on causes I care deeply about, particularly education equity, healthcare access, and economic empowerment. Specifically, I would donate to:¬†



Partners In Health¬†
For their dedication to healthcare equity, delivering quality medical care in resource-limited regions globally, especially Africa and Haiti.



Code.org¬†
To support expanding access to computer science education, particularly to underserved schools, helping bridge educational inequalities and fueling long-term economic mobility.
Black Girls Code 
Its mission is deeply aligned with diversity, inclusion, and long-term transformation.¬†It delivers skills, confidence, and mentorship to underrepresented youth in tech.¬†It has demonstrated growth and an ambitious goal of training one million girls by 2040




1. (D) Demonstrated Customer Willingness to Pay  
This is the strongest indicator of a startup‚Äôs potential viability. A clear demonstration that customers are willing and eager to pay for a solution validates the core idea, proves product-market fit, and substantially lowers execution risk.

2. (A) Personal Fit with Idea  
Alignment between founders and the idea is crucial. Passion, relevant experience, and deep personal motivation significantly improve resilience, increase problem-solving ability, and help founders effectively communicate and execute their vision.

3. (B) Total Addressable Market (TAM)  
A sizable, clearly-defined market ensures potential scalability. Even a great idea will struggle to grow and sustain without enough room to expand and capture meaningful value.

4. (C) Number of Competitors in the Market  
While important, competition alone isn‚Äôt a definitive indicator of potential. A crowded market might indicate a validated customer need. A differentiated offering can succeed despite competitors; conversely, lack of competition may suggest low customer interest rather than opportunity.
