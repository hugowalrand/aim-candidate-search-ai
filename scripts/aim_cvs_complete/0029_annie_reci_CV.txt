 Going to the gym last year is something I am proud of as I was quite anxious to start it, and now over time I have been able to build a consistent routine, improved my agility, and gained more confidence not just physically but also mentally. This journey has taught me resilience, self - discipline.

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay  

If people are willing to pay, then this gives a clear idea that your solution brings value to consumers lives.   

(A) Personal fit with the idea 

A strong personal connection with the idea, suggests that you are more able to understand the customer on a deeper level and more effectively. Which also aids in increasing resilience, authenticity and long - term motivation to maintain commitment to the goal.

(B) Total addressable market 

A broad market opportunity won't matter if your solution does not resonate with customers. It's more useful for planning future growth than determining short term effectiveness. 

(C) Number of competitors 



A crowded market can be a strong indicator that the problem is important and valuable to solve.
