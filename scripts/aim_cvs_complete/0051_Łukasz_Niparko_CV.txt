 I cherish gardening and I am getting better and better in keeping my small plot of veggie abundance.

I was responsible for corporate social responsibility fundraising and external donors management (private and public sectors) but not non-philanthropic ones.

If I made such money, I would donate at least 10% of my income¬†and make my pledge with Giving What We Can, and donate my income to GiveWell.

The most essential to me is the total addressable market because it can determine the volume of impact of the startup; followed by the willingness to pay as it speaks to viabilibilty of the project and its potential to grow and be sustainable. The founder's personal fit can slo speak to the quality of execution of this project especially in hard times requiring resilience. Last I put the number of competitors, for as we know from Effective Altruism perspective such may in fact mean the neglected area or the mere volume of competitors does not determine their effectiveness.
