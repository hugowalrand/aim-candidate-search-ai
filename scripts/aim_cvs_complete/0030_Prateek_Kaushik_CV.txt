 I have the best friends in the world !!! I am grateful to have been able to work and live around the world for various projects and have learned to truly appreciate and love people who have led distinctly different lives than me.

I have considered my basic living expenses first. To pay for rent, I would spend 20,000$ a year. I spend an average of 1000$ on food per month, and I prioritize organic produce and high nutrition foods which can sometimes be more expensive, as it directly affects my health and wellbeing. I also spend some of that budget eating out with friends to try new cuisines. In addition, I allot around 500$ a month for a gym membership, exercise classes, and travel related to any of my sporting competitions. I also allot 10,000$ for any travel related expenditures such as seeing family abroad or in another state, and a vacation. Lastly, I allot 10,000$ for any amount of money that I would need for other miscellaneous purchases or as an emergency fund. Where I live, I would be taxed around 35% which would be around 50,000$. After my annual expenditures and tax, I would be left with around 60,000$. When choosing what charities to donate to, I care about a variety of things. Namely, I care about the charity's track record when it comes to transparency, measurable impact, and the motivations/value alignment I have with the people working at the charity. In addition, from a timeline perspective, it is important to donate to the right charities at the right time to ensure that the impact per dollar is as high as possible. With my remaining 40,000$, I would keep 25,000$ in savings/retirement fund, and then donate the remaining 15,000$ to high impact charities. As of right now, I would donate 10000$ to¬†https://www.pmdphawaii.org/ . They have already removed over a million pounds of plastic pollution in Hawaii, which saves some of the most biodiverse islands in western Hawaiian Islands which allows for a more diverse ecosystem. They thoroughly analyze data to figure out where to maximize their time in ocean clean up day to day to figure out where it is most effective to clean up plastic on a given day based on currents, wind and which fish colonies are most susceptible to endangerment from plastic. Previously having worked as an underwater archaeologist, I have a personal interest in underwater biodiversity, and from a climate change perspective, it has consequential impact in terms of food and fishing ecosystems both locally and for exporting. By donating the money to them now, they would be able to increase their capacity for ocean clean up and invest more money into R&D to develop other solutions for scaling plastic impact that could be used in other parts of the world. I would donate the remaining 5000$ to Against Malaria Foundation as I have been doing in the past to raise money for malaria nets to reduce deaths caused by the disease.

Ranking in descending order: A, B&C, D¬†

Personal fit with the idea would be how I could maintain consistent motivation to work, which is why I ranked it highest. When I have a personal drive associated with a startup idea, it is far easier to think innovatively about the problem space, as well as continuously be able to relate/connect different things in daily life to the space.¬†

I think both the TAM and Competitor Landscape are equally important to me, because I believe the information goes hand in hand. If there are many competitors, but a huge TAM, it may still make a lot of sense to create a company in that space because there is a larger pie. If the TAM was smaller, but we felt as though the competitors were lacking a lot of key features/their solution wasn't complete and had strong conviction we could build a better product or had some sort of competitive edge, it would be worth it to pursue the project. I also think many competitors in a space is an indicator of potential in the problem space, which is a positive. My personal belief is that solving any sort of problem is completely possible to collaborate on even in a for-profit environment, and if there are many competitors, but some that we heavily align with, I would love to explore options to work alongside that team. While the TAM is a useful stat, it sometimes feels fickle to me, because I feel that you can increase the addressable market with additional features or social movements. It is also difficult to very accurately estimate market share, but a general ballpark is always useful to consider. I ranked it second alongside competitors, because it allows us to have some ballpark of the ceiling of our project. That ceiling is important to consider to estimate time that could be dedicated to the project to predict how the market may change over the years.¬†

I ranked D last because I truly believe that if you build a product that is undeniably valuable, then people will eventually buy the product. In addition, I believe that willingness can be swayed based on the product itself, circumstances, marketing, and social movements, which I believe we can either manufacture or persuade for.¬†
