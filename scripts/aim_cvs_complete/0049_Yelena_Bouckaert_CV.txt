 Startup Experience 
 In 2022, I completed my first Sprint Triathlon in the UK and used it to raise over €3,000 for two non-profits in Belgium and Congo focused on education and forest restoration. Finishing the race was a physical challenge, but supporting meaningful work was the real win.

I have not raised any commercial funding

If I made $150,000 a year, I’d commit to giving 10%  ($15,000) every year to charity.

I’d split that donation into two parts. Half would go to organizations I know personally or have been directly involved with (Seeds for Change, DUO for a job, Pulse Foundation). The other half would go to globally recognized charities that focus on causes I care deeply about: education, women’s entrepreneurship, and sustainable agriculture. These are the issues that feel closest to my identity and how I want to contribute to the world.

What connects all the charities I’d choose is a focus on effectiveness and transparency. I want to see where the money goes and understand the real impact it’s having. Ideally, they’d have a strong presence on the ground, especially in Belgium and across the African continent, since those are the regions I feel most tied to.

Now, why 10%? For one, I want to stay realistic. I’d rather commit to 10% and stick to it (or even go beyond it) than overpromise and underdeliver. I’m 22 years old, and while giving is a core value of mine, I also need to be honest about my own financial goals. I want to be able to buy a home one day, support a family, and still live sustainably.

That’s also why I see giving in broader terms. Besides the 10% I’d donate, I’d dedicate another portion of my income toward building a more sustainable life, which includes investing in solar energy, local food, or eco-friendly products. Those choices often cost more upfront but align with the same values. Besides that, I would invest an additional 10% of my salary in impact funds or even launch my own, using patient capital to back meaningful change. Something inspired by models like Acumen.

1. Personal fit with the idea  
2. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay  

3. Total addressable market

4. Number of competitors  

First and foremost, personal fit is everything for me. I want to spend my time working on something that truly excites me. If I don’t care deeply about the topic or problem, I won’t have the same drive to push through challenges or stay committed long-term. The idea needs to resonate with what I value: education, women’s empowerment, and sustainable, healthy agriculture. These are the themes that get me out of bed in the morning. We only get about 80,000 working hours in our lives. I want to use mine wisely.

Second is proof that people are actually willing to pay for what you're offering. Ideas are easy to fall in love with, but if nobody wants what you’re building, you’re wasting your time. I’ve worked in an early-stage startup and saw firsthand how easy it is to focus on the product instead of the problem. That’s why it’s crucial to listen to your users and validate demand early on.

Third is total addressable market. I care about building something that can grow and create impact at scale. I’d rather serve 1% of a huge market than dominate a tiny niche with limited upside. Big markets give you room to evolve, pivot, and expand your vision over time.

Last is the number of competitors. It's not irrelevant, but it’s not a dealbreaker either. Competition can be a sign of market demand, but it also means your impact might just be incremental. I’d rather be in a space where I can do something truly new, where I can carve my own path, even if it’s riskier. That’s often where the most meaningful innovations come from.
