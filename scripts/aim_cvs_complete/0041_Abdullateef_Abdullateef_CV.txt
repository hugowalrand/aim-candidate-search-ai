 I'm proud of organizing a community art/culture event with friends that brought together students, local artists, and vendors to celebrate creativity and self-expression. Started as a small idea, grew into a space that connected people, promoted local talent, and sparked meaningful conversations.

If I made $150,000 USD in salary per year, I would commit to donating at least 10% of my income ($15,000) annually to high-impact, evidence-based charities. I’d split the amount between global health, education, and long-term development causes that have shown measurable results and cost-effectiveness.  1. Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) – $6,000  
AMF provides long-lasting insecticide-treated nets to prevent malaria in high-risk regions. Malaria is a leading cause of death in children under five, and AMF is one of the most cost-effective charities in the world. With roughly $5 per net and strong data on how many lives it saves, this donation could help protect over 1,000 people, possibly saving multiple lives.  
2. GiveDirectly – $3,000  
GiveDirectly sends cash transfers directly to people living in extreme poverty, allowing them to choose what they need most. Studies have shown this approach can lead to improved food security, health, and small business growth. I value dignity and autonomy, and GiveDirectly’s approach respects both while delivering tangible results.  
3. Educate Girls (via The Life You Can Save) – $3,000  
As someone passionate about education and community development, I’d support Educate Girls, which focuses on enrolling out-of-school girls in India and improving learning outcomes. Every $100 spent through them brings a girl back to school. Education is a multiplier, it reduces poverty, improves health, and increases future income, especially for girls.  
4. GiveWell Maximum Impact Fund – $3,000  
For the remaining amount, I’d contribute to GiveWell’s Maximum Impact Fund. This fund directs money to the most cost-effective opportunities available at any given time based on ongoing research. It allows flexibility while keeping the focus on measurable, life-saving impact.  
I would choose these organizations because they:

Have strong, transparent evidence of impact

Focus on problems that are urgent, solvable, and often neglected

Make the most of every dollar spent

Align with my values around dignity, education, and global justice

Donating with intention, guided by effective altruism, means I can help improve and even save lives, not just support good causes. This is how I would use my income to create the most meaningful change possible

Here’s how I would rank the factors, from most important to least important:

1. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay (D)  
2. Personal fit with the idea (A)  
3. Total addressable market (B)  
4. Number of competitors in the market (C) 

When evaluating the potential of a startup idea, I would prioritize demonstrated customer willingness to pay above all else. It’s the clearest sign that the idea is solving a real problem for real people. If customers are willing to exchange their money for a solution, that’s powerful evidence of actual demand, not just interest or support, but commitment. I’ve seen promising ideas fail not because they weren’t clever or needed, but because no one was willing to pay for them. That’s why validation through paying users is more valuable to me than theoretical market projections or enthusiasm alone.

Next, I’d consider personal fit with the idea. Building a startup is a tough, emotional journey, and a strong connection to the problem helps a founder stay focused and resilient. When someone understands the problem from lived experience or deep interest, they tend to build better solutions and connect more authentically with users. It also increases the likelihood that they’ll stick with the idea through its ups and downs, pivot thoughtfully if needed, and push through setbacks, not just chase a trend.

Third, I’d look at the total addressable market. It’s important because it tells you whether the idea can grow over time. But I don’t think it matters much at the very beginning. A startup doesn’t need to serve millions right away; it needs to find its first hundred people who care deeply about the solution. A smaller, well-defined market with high need often beats a massive but vague one. Once there’s traction and product–market fit, then TAM becomes a more serious factor for scale and long-term planning.

Finally, the number of competitors is least important to me. In fact, some competition can be a good sign that the problem is real and pressing. What matters more is how well the startup can differentiate itself, through better execution, a unique insight, or a stronger relationship with a niche audience. Being the only player in a market doesn’t mean much if no one wants what you're building. I’d rather see a team entering a “crowded” space with a fresh, focused approach than one chasing novelty for its own sake.
