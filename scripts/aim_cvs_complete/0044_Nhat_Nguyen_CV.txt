 Domain Expertise, Management, Startup Experience 
 I started Fund For Dreams, an NGO to fund impoverished students in Vietnam and Nepal to achieve their dreams to escape poverty through education. Since 2017, we have raised $150k to give out 550 annual scholarships to 145 students. 

I have not raised commercial funding.

That is around the range that I make in the last few years, and I have been donating on average $2.5k to NGOs. Without my student loans and taking care of my family members, I would change it to $10,000. Most goes to Fund For Dreams (FFD), the NGO that I started to help students in Vietnam and Nepal (current only in Vietnam) to escape poverty through education. Some goes to other educational NGOs as well such as Teach For Vietnam, Vietseed, Passerellas Numeriques Vietnam.

Education has a significant impact in changing people's lives for the better, and it lasts over the generations. It transformed my life and my family's lives from growing up in poverty in Vietnam and now working and living in Silicon Valley and brought my family over to the US. Growing up, I have seen a number of my classmates quitting schools because their family were poor. They end up being farmers (on a very small and limited land in Vietnam, not the type in the US),  or working minimum wages in clothing factories. And then their children will repeat the cycle of poverty that they experienced. Education doesn't guarantee that they will get a good job, but it improves their chance of getting better opportunties, or even create their own opportunies as they learn and grow and get the broader exposure to have more confidence in their ability. 

With Fund For Dreams, we provide yearly grant to students to pay for tuition, school fees, health insurance, and light mentorship from the team members and volunteers as the students navigate thiee educational journey as first gen collge students. 

For Teach For Vietnam, they are helping to improve the quality of education in Vietnam through helping teachers to be better teachers. It is something that I care deeply as well as all students from Fund For Dreams go to public schools, and the teachers have significant impact on their lives. It is better for them to go to school than not, but ideally if they can get good education that can best help them to grow and prepare for their future to escape poverty. 

Vietseed is a similar organization as FFD in Vietnam but only focuses on college students. They have larger funding for college students and stronger mentorship model than what we are currently doing at Fund For Dreams but they have a more stringent criteria so it is harder for our students to get it, but for the ones that do, they are super helpful.

Passerellas Numeriques Vietnam provides free training for students from poor families in Vietnam study computer science. One of the students from FFD is graduating this year and she has grown a lot in the last 3 years.  


All the organizations are in Vietnam because I see that my money can make larger impact there to many more people than donating to NGOs in the US. I am open to other NGOs in other countries as well in the future though. 

1. Personal fit with idea: with my startup, I think about it every second. So it has to be something I believe that it will make the world a better place, hence I would enjoy reading more and talking to people about it to spend all my energy working on it. I am open & excited to learn new things so I am not tied to the things that I have experience in but it would be helpful for me to leverage my experience as it could accelerate the startup process earlier.

2. Demonstrated customer willlingness to pay: This is after the personal fit because there are so many products and services that people are willing to pay for, so it is about choosing the things that people are willing to pay for and I am interested in spending all my time in. 

3. Total addressable market: Without the first two, this doesn't matter as much. Though after the first two, this is an important factor because it is connected to the size of the impact the company can have in the future. 

4. Number of competitors in the market: This is important, but if I am in a $500B market, it is ok to have 10x number of competitors in the market as if I am in a $1B market. Also, if my product is good enough to serve even just 1% of the 500B market, that is already $5B ARR.
