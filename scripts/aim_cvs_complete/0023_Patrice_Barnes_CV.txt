 I founded the Legacy Scholarship Initiative to uplift first-gen leaders through funding and mentorship. It’s a sacred act of reinvestment—designing equity, healing, and legacy into systems that often forget who they’re meant to serve.

N/A

I would donate at least $75,000 annually—50% or more—to a portfolio of organizations aligned with healing, equity, and cultural transformation. This includes:

Black Emotional and Mental Health Collective (BEAM) – advancing healing justice for Black communities
Girls for Gender Equity (GGE) – empowering young women and gender-expansive youth of color
The Loveland Foundation – providing therapy and support for Black women and girls
The Highlander Center – cultivating grassroots leadership and movement-building in the South
Local mutual aid networks – sustaining proximity-based care and economic dignity

  

These organizations reflect my belief in proximity, ancestral stewardship, and systems-level healing. My giving is not transactional—it’s a commitment to legacy, redistribution, and moral ambition.

When evaluating the potential of a startup idea, I prioritize energetic alignment, community resonance, and the capacity to build systems that heal and transform. Through the lens of my High Frequency philosophy, which centers clarity, proximity, and moral ambition, my ranking is as follows:

1. (A) Personal Fit with Idea – Most Important
Founders are not just builders—they are stewards. A startup rooted in personal fit carries the frequency of lived experience, ancestral insight, and visionary bandwidth. When a founder is deeply aligned with the problem space, the venture becomes more than a business—it becomes a vehicle for transformation. Personal fit fuels resilience, clarity, and authentic storytelling. It attracts aligned collaborators, investors, and communities. In my own work, ventures born from personal conviction have sustained impact far beyond metrics—they’ve shifted culture, policy, and collective imagination.

2. (D) Demonstrated Customer Willingness to Pay
Energetic resonance must meet material validation. If customers are already paying—or clearly ready to—this signals urgency, relevance, and trust. Willingness to pay is not just about revenue; it’s about relational exchange. It shows that the solution meets a real need and that the founder has tapped into a frequency of service that people value. In high-frequency ventures, this feedback loop is sacred—it guides product evolution, deepens community engagement, and affirms that the offering is energetically attuned to its audience.

3. (B) Total Addressable Market (TAM)
Scale matters, but only when it’s aligned. A massive TAM is irrelevant if the founder lacks clarity or if the solution doesn’t resonate with those most impacted. I prioritize depth over breadth—an underserved niche with high pain and strong willingness to pay can catalyze systems change more effectively than a broad market with weak signals. TAM becomes meaningful when paired with moral ambition: Who are we serving, and why does it matter?

4. (C) Number of Competitors in the Market – Least Important
Competition is not a threat—it’s a mirror. It reflects demand, validates the space, and invites differentiation. In high-frequency ventures, the goal is not to dominate but to elevate. A saturated market with weak incumbents is often ripe for disruption, especially when the founder brings a unique lens, community proximity, or cultural fluency. What matters most is how the founder holds complexity, navigates ambiguity, and builds with integrity.

In sum, I evaluate startup ideas through a lens of energetic alignment, community impact, and systems-level healing. I believe ventures should not only scale—they should resonate. They should redistribute power, restore dignity, and reflect the frequencies of the future we’re here to build.
