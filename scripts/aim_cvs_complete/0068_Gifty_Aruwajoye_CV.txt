 In January 2025, I founded the Beyond Sweat Foundation. I opened up about my hyperhidrosis journey on YouTube, created a website, developed a trigger-tracking app, and even started a WhatsApp support group. Taking these steps make me proud knowing others won't have to go through the journey alone.

Annual Donation:

$30,000 USD (20% of salary)

Recipients:

1. Against Malaria Foundation (AMF): 50% ($15,000)

2. Beyond Sweat Foundation: 50% ($15,000)

Why These Organizations?

AMF is all about making a real difference with every dollar spent. They distribute insecticide-treated bed nets, which helps prevent malaria at an impressive cost of around $3,000 per life saved (verified by GiveWell). This approach really resonates with my commitment to evidence-based giving‚Äîit's all about maximizing lives saved while tackling a serious issue in the underserved communities I want to support with hyperhidrosis solutions.

- Beyond Sweat Foundation

is key to our shared mission. The funding goes straight into scaling our symptom-tracking app and community support programs for those dealing with hyperhidrosis in emerging markets. This isn‚Äôt just charity‚Äîit‚Äôs about building infrastructure. Every dollar we invest helps grow our user base, confirms the treatment needs, and reduces the risks as we roll out affordable devices in the market.

Why 20%?

As a founder who‚Äôs committed to pledging future profits through FTG, I believe in making sacrifices today. This 20% allocation strikes a balance between addressing urgent global needs (like those tackled by AMF) and investing in our core mission (Beyond Sweat). It‚Äôs all about ensuring sustainability while embracing the "give now" philosophy.

Ranking:

  

(D) Customer willingness to pay

  

(A) Personal connection to the idea

  

(B) Total addressable market

  

(C) Number of competitors

  

Reasoning:

1. Customer willingness to pay (D) is crucial. It confirms there's a real problem and a sustainable solution. Take my hyperhidrosis venture as an example: people are willing to spend $500 a month on botox or iontophoresis machines, even with other options available. This indicates:

  

Scalable benefit: Profits can help expand access

  

Urgency: Underserved communities recognize their own needs

  

2. Personal connection (A) fuels my determination. Having dealt with hyperhidrosis for a decade and seeing the growth of the Beyond Sweat Foundation (with app users and community expansion) means:

  

I grasp the subtle challenges (like stigma in emerging markets)

  

It builds trust for sensitive health solutions

  

3. The total market (B) is important for understanding the potential impact ‚Äì but only if (D) and (A) are solid. With over 200 million hyperhidrosis sufferers in Africa and Asia, we see a huge opportunity because we‚Äôve already demonstrated demand.

  

4. Competitors (C) don‚Äôt matter much for overlooked issues. Treatments for hyperhidrosis haven‚Äôt changed in 20 years because big companies tend to ignore "embarrassing" conditions. The lack of competition shows there‚Äôs a chance for real change.

This ranking emphasizes the evidence of need (D) and the founder's determination (A) over theoretical markets (B) or crowded fields (C). It reflects how Beyond Sweat uncovered a $10 billion demand for affordable treatments by listening to those who suffer, rather than just crunching numbers.
