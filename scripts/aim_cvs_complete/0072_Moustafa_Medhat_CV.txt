 I was awarded scholarships totaling over 200,000 euros, enabling me to study and conduct research across five different countries. Among them was the highly prestigious French Government Scholarship, which had an exceptionally competitive selection rate of just 0.5%.

NA

I will donate 5–10% of my post-tax income to high impact organizations focused on youth empowerment and education. 73% of the global working force have jobs that aren’t related to their higher-education degree. That just shows how ineffective our global educational system is.

(A) Personal fit with idea

(D) Demonstrated customer willingness to pay  
(B) Total addressable market  
(C) Number of competitors in the market  
I believe that founder-idea fit is super important, the founder should be interested in the problem space to feel the pain of users. Secondly Demonstrated customer willingness to pay, without revenue there is no sustainability. Then, Total addressable market, if there are not many people suffering the problem/pain then it is not a priority and it is less impact. Finaly, Number of competitors in the market, it is important to evaluate the market that i will penetrate to determine the best go to market strategy.
