 I helped connect a school in a rural area to gain access to electricity for the first time and rented a projector for a period of 11 months with my own money so the students could learn in a more visual and engaging way and sparked a new sense of curiosity in the classroom.

Accelerator funding & VC funding. My role included preparing and submitting the applications, developing and presenting the pitch materials, and representing the team during investor meetings and demo days. I led the articulation of our value proposition and strategic roadmap, which were critical in gaining investor confidence.

In line with the giving what we can pledge, I will donate at least 10% annually towards organizations¬†with a well documented track record of saving lives or making an impact cost effectively. An organization which ticks these boxes is Against Malaria Foundation.

1. Personal fit with the idea: startups are demanding and fraught with uncertainty. A founder who is deeply connected to the idea is more likely to make the right long term decisions.

2. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay: this distinguishes between a vitamin (nice to have) and a pain killer (must have) solution. It signals urgent demand and real world relevance, i.e., solves a real problem.

3. Total addressable market: this indicates the growth potential of the venture. All things being equal, a larger market opens the door to greater impact and scalability.

4. Number of competitors: this could mean the problem is worth solving and indicates a well validated and important problem. What matters more is whether one's solution or approach offers meaningful differentiation or solves the problem better.
