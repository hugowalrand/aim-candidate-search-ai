 Domain Expertise, Management 
 I love the peace I have after speaking with people, and the warmth they feel when we speak - regardless of how tense things had been before. I don't have the best words to describe it; someone recently told me this: "You are so cathartic when people talk to you" - and that describes it so much.

We bootstrapped the company and later raised over $500k from philanthropic donors for some public-interest projects. I was in charge of funding and funder relations - as founding team and COO.

I will give between 10% and 25% of my earned income. I'll make those donations through a fund I set up at AllforDevelopment.¬†  

I may make donations to Helen Keler, Fortify Health and Family Empowerment Media. I chose Helen Keler because of their work in reducing blindness and poor vision in Africa and Asia, Fortify Health for their iron fortification program and FEM for their impact getting more people to make informed health decisions in Nigeria. I gauge my funding interest based on how effective their solutions are, the impact they have in terms of reach and based on whether or not more funding will be useful/helpful.

I'll also be on the look out for organisations that work on either eradicating river blindness in Africa or any effective charity that help pregnant women improve birth outcomes for themselves and their new born - including help during post-partum depression and stress.

While organisations that provide what can help save people's lives matter, I love initiatives that do that and help people improve in agency so that they can decide better next time.¬†

I'll rank based on:

1. My personal fit with the idea

2. Demonstrated customer willingness to pay

3. Total addressable market

4. Competitors in the market.

1. I like to work on issues I look forward to waking up to work on. I don't have to be 'passionate' about the idea; I just have to be able to see myself growing into an obsession and stretching my comfort zone by working on it. I don't mind an area where I am no expert either - most of the entities I've helped build were in areas I had no expertise before hand, and areas I grew in expertise over time.

2. So, I am a fan of building for a niche group that can comfortably and sustainably pay for the product or service we render. Not because they like us, but because we've put enough care into what we built and we've made something they keep using and telling others about because it is valuable to them. Yes, I will prioritise building something that customers willingly pay for over and again. People often spend based on value, not just cost.

3. I smile when my any of my friend talk to me about TAM. Because it's often accompanied by "imagine we could get just 1% of this market". It's laudable, but sometimes it is a misplaced priority if it stands in the way of strong execution. If it stands in the way of building something that users themselves tell others about.

4. Having competition in the market sometimes is a signal that there is value in that market. If we have great products and we can find ways to make those we want to serve know about and use those product, I won't bother much about the competition. Instead, I'll be thinking about how to lean in to what makes us different and better.
