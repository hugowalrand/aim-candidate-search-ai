 Domain Expertise, Startup Experience 
 I helped a mentee in Ukraine get into her top choice of graduate school. It was an honor and pleasure to support and guide someone through the process.

N/A

UA Mental Help and Razom for Ukraine. Both organizations are working on raising funds to support access to mental health resources and the reconstruction of the healthcare system.

In order of priority

(B) Total addressable market: While a larger market does not equal better, it's important to me that there is potential for impact in a large market.¬†

(A) Personal fit: This is something that motivates me when external factors get challenging. If there is no personal fit, it is difficult to overcome challenges.¬†

(D)WTP: Understanding this factor is more important than the number. This bodes well for longer term company sustainability and confidence within the team. There is always a chance that the number can change or increase depending on external events.¬†

(C)Number of competitors in the market: A saturated space does not always indicate quality of product and customer satisfaction. It might point to challenges in development, but might still be worth it if the other factors are in the green.¬†¬†
