 Management 
 I led 10 volunteer mural projects for an NGO, transforming dull walls with locals and children. Learning tattooing alongside this showed me how art, whether on public walls or personal skin, can spark connection and meaning.

N/A

If I earned $150,000 annually, I would donate at least $5,000 to Moto Paws, an organization in India that provides reflective collars and care to street dogs across the country. I would also contribute around $5,000 to a local veterinary hospital near my home that regularly feeds and cares for stray dogs in the community. Additionally, back in my hometown in India, I‚Äôve been part of a small group of girls who hand-paint merchandise, like bags, caps, and shirts, to raise funds for dog vaccinations and food. I would love to continue supporting these grassroots efforts, as this money would have a direct and meaningful impact on improving the lives of the dogs we care for.

My ranking is B, D, A, C.

First, the total addressable market (B) is the most important because even if a product is high quality, its potential impact depends on the size of the audience it can reach. In today‚Äôs crowded startup ecosystem, finding a product that can serve a large population increases the chances of success significantly.

Second is demonstrated customer willingness to pay (D). As a service and product designer, I‚Äôve learned that truly listening to users is critical. When customers are willing to pay for a product, it‚Äôs a strong indicator that it meets a real need, and that success is likely. Willingness to pay reflects genuine demand and is a key validation for the product‚Äôs value.

Third is personal fit with the idea (A). While I believe motivation is even more important than personal fit, being connected to the idea helps sustain long-term commitment. However, if the motivation is strong and there is clear user demand, I‚Äôm confident I can work passionately on any project that contributes meaningfully.

Finally, the number of competitors in the market (C) is least important. While standing out from competitors matters, having many competitors doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean failure. With the right motivation, unique approach, and dedication, it‚Äôs possible to succeed despite competition, just like Burger King thrived even after McDonald‚Äôs. Ultimately, how you execute matters more than how crowded the market is.
